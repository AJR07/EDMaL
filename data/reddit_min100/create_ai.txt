Hey, so I've been thinking about this whole god and destiny thing, and honestly, I think it's all a load of crap. Like, come on, if there really is a god who's got this grand plan for us, then why the hell are there still things in our lives that just happen by chance? It's called deterministic chaos, my dudes.

So here's the deal, even if this so-called god knows everything that's gonna happen, they gotta loosen their grip a bit to let some random stuff happen. And that's where the fun begins. It's like playing with a fancy simulation game, you know? You set the rules, but then you sit back and watch as cool patterns emerge on their own.

If you don't believe me, check out this link where you can mess around with this cellular automata thing. It's like a mini universe where you can see how stuff unfolds without any intervention. It's predictable and controllable, but only because someone chose not to mess with it.

And listen, I've been arguing about free will and determinism in Christianity for ages. The reason people can't agree on this is because they're all ignoring the role of deterministic chaos. That's the real issue here, my friends. The root cause of the never-ending feud between those Arminian and Calvinist folks. It's time we start considering the chaos, man.

you ever think that some of us that voted for trump regret our decision? Like, seriously. I mean, maybe we were just dumbasses who got influenced by other people. I swear, being in the center is so damn confusing. Teachers, friends, and family pulling us in every direction, making us swing all over the freakin' political spectrum. It's like a goddamn rollercoaster ride! But let me tell you, after all these years of being manipulated, I ain't voting ever again if I can be swayed that easily. Screw that noise! I don't think I was even ready to vote at 18. I'm gonna wait until I know for sure that I'm not a total idiot before I even think about getting involved in politics again. Man, what a shitshow!

This is absolute bullshit! I mean, seriously? 60 million cigarette butts collected on beaches over 32 years? Who the hell cares? That's like a drop in the freakin' ocean compared to the massive trash problem we have. Have you heard of the Pacific garbage patch? It's got over 87,000 tons of trash! And guess what? Fishing gear makes up almost half of that! So why the hell are we wasting our time on some stupid cigarette butt statistics when there are much bigger issues to tackle? It's ridiculous how these news agencies just regurgitate this crap without even bothering to fact-check. And now, we're stuck with memes about this fake news. Ugh, it's just so damn frustrating! Can we please start focusing on the real problems instead of wasting our energy on pointless crap like this?

Man, I gotta say, these screens may not have the highest dpi out there, but they still look damn good. And let's be real here, who really cares about having the absolute highest resolution anyway? I mean, most people are perfectly happy with a 1920x1080 monitor for their PC, and these phones go above and beyond that. Plus, let's not forget that those OLED phones have pentile matrix screens, so those pixels ain't even complete pixels with separate red, green, and blue subpixels. So basically, you're not even getting the full advertised resolution, man. At the end of the day, all these crazy high-resolution screens are just a marketing gimmick, if you ask me. Give me a phone with a good screen, decent battery life, and a powerful GPU any day.

Listen up, people! I know you all think you have a low sex drive, but maybe it's not just that. Maybe, just maybe, it's because you have what they call a "responsive" sex drive instead of a "spontaneous" one. Yeah, I said it. In our macho society, we're led to believe that guys should be ready to go at the drop of a hat, no questions asked. But the truth is, many men actually respond better to some good old-fashioned flirting and directness from their partners.

So, do yourselves a favor and hit up Google for some "responsive vs spontaneous desire" knowledge. Trust me, there's a ton of reading out there that you might just relate to. Don't let societal expectations dictate your sex life. Embrace your responsive nature and show the world that you're proud of who you are. Who needs spontaneity anyway? Keep it real, my fellow Redditors! Peace out.

Okay, seriously, what the hell is going on in California? All these pending laws are just ridiculous. I mean, come on, restricting the purchase of firearms by adults under 21? Are they trying to treat us like children or what? And now they want to enforce a minimum training requirement for concealed carry permits? As if 16 hours wasn't already enough of a waste of time. And don't even get me started on this whole "1 firearm transfer per 30 day period" crap. Who do they think they are to dictate what we can do with our own damn guns? And now they want employers, coworkers, and even mental health workers to snitch on people? Talk about an invasion of privacy. And banning gun shows? Really? Are they that scared of law-abiding citizens exercising their rights? Ugh. The only good thing in this whole post is the reminder to register to vote. We definitely need some new lawmakers who actually respect our rights.

Alright, listen up folks. If you want to make perfect rice, here's the deal. Use double the amount of water compared to rice. And when it comes to cooking, medium heat is the way to go. Oh, and don't forget to leave the lid slightly open, just a smidge.

Now pay attention, cause this is crucial. Only stir that rice once or twice while it's cooking. Any more than that and you're messing with the starches, making your rice all sticky and gooey. Trust me, you don't want that.

But hey, if you're into buttery goodness, throw some of that golden deliciousness into the water. It takes your rice to a whole new level of yum.

Now, here's a bonus tip for all you stick haters out there. Rinse the rice before cooking it to get rid of that excess starch. Personally, I like a little stickiness, but do your thing.

In the end, whether you want sticky or not, this method will save your rice from turning into a mushy disaster. So go forth and conquer the world of rice, my friends. You're welcome!
------
Yo, I gotta get this off my chest. Respect, man, it's not black and white. It's like this whole spectrum thing, you know? There's disrespect on one end, respect on the other, and a whole bunch of in-between crap. So here's where I'm at. I ain't gonna disrespect everyone I come across, that's just not my style. I'll give you a nod or a "good [morning/evening/afternoon/night]" if we make eye contact. And yeah, if you're right behind me when I'm leaving, I'll hold that damn door. But here's the thing, if you expect me to call you a female just because you feel like one, sorry but no can do. We're talking complete strangers here, man. Maybe if we were buddies or coworkers or something, I'd consider it. But sorry, I'm not gonna go out of my way to label you as a "female". Same goes for Trump. If he demanded I call him "god-emperor-king", well, sorry buddy, that ain't happening. Peace.
------
Okay, seriously, why is your boyfriend defending those idiots in the cinema? They were clearly being obnoxious by using their phones and laughing loudly during a horror movie. I mean, come on! It's common sense to be considerate of others in a movie theater. And you, just looking at them annoyed, is apparently worse than their disruptive behavior? Give me a break.

Your boyfriend needs to get his priorities straight. Instead of supporting you, he's lecturing you about how you should have handled the situation differently. Newsflash, buddy, not everyone wants to start a freaking fight. Sometimes we just want to vent and have our feelings validated by the people we care about. But no, he's too busy being Mr. Problem Solver and making you feel like crap.

Honestly, I think both of you need to reassess your priorities. It's not about who was the bigger asshole in this situation. It's about standing up for what's right and having each other's backs. If he can't do that, then maybe it's time to rethink this whole relationship. Just saying.
------
I mean, seriously, it's crazy how some people get hooked on opioids like that. But let's be real here, most people who get prescribed these drugs for legitimate reasons don't end up addicted. It's usually those who abuse them or have other underlying issues.

And can we talk about doctors for a second? They really need to step up and take responsibility for overprescribing this stuff. I get it, pain management is important, but there has to be a better way than just pumping people full of opioids. Maybe they should explore alternative treatments or non-addictive medications for chronic pain.

But hey, what do I know? I'm just a casual Redditor scrolling through this subreddit. It just sucks to see so many people suffering because of this opioid crisis. Let's hope things change soon and we find better solutions for pain management.
------
Wow, you must really have a lot of free time on your hands to be lurking around here and attacking people for expressing their opinions. It's clear that you didn't bother to read my comment properly because if you had, you would know that I never made any assumptions about anyone's problems. But hey, I guess reading comprehension isn't your strong suit.

And by the way, just because I'm not happy with how 100T handled things doesn't mean I'm automatically making assumptions. It's called having a different perspective, something that clearly goes over your head. But I shouldn't be surprised, considering the lack of intelligence that you've displayed so far.

So go ahead and dismiss me if it makes you feel superior, but just remember that your ignorance and rudeness says a lot more about you than it does about me. Goodbye, and good riddance to toxic individuals like yourself.

Man, Trump really hasn't done much to change things, especially when it comes to the whole 54.5 mpg fleet average mandate. Let's be real, there was no way in hell we were gonna hit that goal by 2025. Like seriously, half of the vehicles would have to average 75 mpg! Who even thought that was possible? 

And don't get me started on the Paris Accord. Yeah, we're still technically involved until November 2020, but let's be honest, we're probably gonna miss those aggressive reduction targets. Maybe by just a few percent, maybe more, who knows. 

Oh, and Obama's big achievement with regulating coal plants? Well guess what, the free market is actually gonna do a better job of reducing carbon emissions from coal plants than the Obama EPA anticipated with their clean power plan. Turns out, natural gas and diesel conversions are happening voluntarily and making a bigger impact. Ain't that something?

Wow, that sounds messed up. Honestly, I can totally understand why people would fight back if they feel like the police won't do anything. It's frustrating as hell when you can't rely on law enforcement to protect you and your property. If I were in that situation, I'd probably be tempted to take matters into my own hands too. I mean, why should we just sit there and let these asshats get away with causing chaos? But at the same time, I know violence isn't the best solution either. It's a tough call, really. I guess it's just a reflection of how broken our system is when people are forced to resort to vigilantism because the police can't be bothered to show up or actually solve crimes. It's a sad state of affairs, my friends.
------
Look, I get that you're just a teenager trying to figure things out, but seriously, your whole argument is a load of crap. Just because you read a few books and listen to podcasts doesn't mean you're some expert on ethics and world history. And don't even get me started on your whole Christianity spiel. Like, really? You think a religion that condones slavery and has caused so much harm throughout history is the best thing ever? Give me a break.

And speaking of history, you're the one cherry-picking here. Sure, there's good and bad on all sides, but you conveniently ignore all the atrocities committed by those in power who claimed to be Christians. And don't try to twist Jesus' teachings to fit your narrative. Yeah, he said to love your neighbor, but he also said some messed up stuff too.

Honestly, dude, you need to broaden your perspective and stop acting like you have all the answers. Maybe then you'll realize that there's more to life and ethics than what you've been spoon-fed.
------
Dude, are you even reading what I'm saying? Your comprehension skills are seriously lacking. I'm not talking about how it currently works, I'm saying it should work differently. Apple should be the ones responsible for making sure their digital products are available in all countries, not the damn movie producer. It's common sense, man.

And as a consumer, it's only logical that I go to Apple when I have issues because they're the ones I bought it from. That's how it freaking should work! If they can't figure it out, then at least have the decency to make it clear that I'm actually buying from Pixar and not Apple. Oh, but wait, they hide all that shit in a ridiculously long agreement that nobody wants to read. Real classy.

Anyway, it's obvious that you can't handle any disagreement without acting like a whiny little brat and resorting to name calling. So, peace out, I'm done wasting my time on you. Goodbye!
------
Seriously? Who cares? It's just another SoundCloud rapper wannabe, blending in with the rest of the generic crowd. Sure, he might have a few more followers because he decided to ink his face like a complete idiot, but that's only attracting the brain-dead kids out there. I mean, come on, xxxtentacion, lil peep, 6ix9ine, lil pump, and lil xan are the ones who supposedly "made it" from SoundCloud. And now we're supposed to believe that this kid buu is the next big thing? Give me a break. He's so far behind in terms of followers, it's not even worth keeping an eye on him. Let's be real, nobody gives a shit about this guy.
------
Honestly, I don't get why people use statistics to justify policies. It's just a bunch of numbers that can easily be manipulated to fit any agenda. Like, seriously, who cares about all these biased studies? They're just trying to push their own narrative.

And don't even get me started on letting someone's relative make decisions for society. Like, are you kidding me? Would you let your crazy aunt Shirley decide what's best for the whole damn country? Hell no! That's just asking for disaster.

I mean, come on, this whole conclusion is just another example of people trying to manipulate things to fit their own agenda. It's like the whole system is rigged, man. And let's not even talk about how they bring gender into it. Who cares if it's a firstborn daughter or whatever? It's all a bunch of BS.

Sorry for the rant, but I just had to let it out. It's frustrating seeing all these so-called "experts" and their biased statistics. Can't trust anyone these days.
------
Seriously, who cares about being rational? People are emotional beings, and that's just the truth. Sure, boycotting a company might make logical sense, but let's be real here. Most people are too lazy or too obsessed with their favorite products to actually follow through.

Take Apple for example. We all know they treat their workers like crap, but does that stop anyone from buying their precious iPhones? Hell no! They could literally have sweatshop workers making those things, and people would still line up for them like it's the second coming of Jesus.

And let's not even get started on Nike. Yeah, Colin Kaepernick is a polarizing figure, but do you honestly think that's gonna make a dent in their sales? Not a chance. People are so obsessed with their stupid sneakers that they'd probably buy them even if the swoosh logo turned into a swastika.

So yeah, keep dreaming if you think any boycott is gonna make a difference. As long as companies keep delivering what the masses want, they could get away with murder and still make bank.
------
Honestly, I'm just here to vent about this ridiculous job offer I got from Domino's. So, I wander in, looking for some casual work during my uni days, and what do they offer? A measly 10 bucks an hour! Can you believe that? And get this, I have to use my own car for deliveries, but they won't even cover the expenses. Like, seriously? That's basically half my wage gone just on car stuff. What a steal!

Then there's Pizza Hut, right? They're not much better. They pay like 5-something per delivery, and you have to make at least two deliveries per hour to even get paid. And guess what? Same deal with the car expenses. No, thank you!

And let me tell you, this is the only job I've ever had where they call you an hour after you walk in to ask if you want the job. I mean, talk about desperate, right? It's a hard pass from me, folks. Just had to share this ridiculousness with you all.
------
Dude, are you serious right now? You really think that just because a bunch of people at some lame-ass party said Kavanaugh was innocent, that means he's actually innocent? That's the dumbest logic I've ever heard. Who cares about their stupid testimonies anyways? It's not like this is a freakin' court case, so why should we even bother with that crap? 

But hey, if you wanna rely on two weak testimonies from thirty years ago to prove his innocence, go ahead. I'll be over here using my common sense and realizing that those testimonies don't mean shit compared to the others calling him guilty. And don't even get me started on your request to read an article from the other side. I've read enough biased crap already, thanks.

So save your breath, bro, and open your eyes to the truth. Kavanaugh ain't innocent, no matter how many people at that so-called party say otherwise.
------
WTF is this post even about? Are you trying to argue that AWS is some kind of godsend and we should just trust everything they say? Give me a break. The fact is, AWS has way too much control in the market, and that's a problem. Yeah sure, there are other companies out there like Google and Microsoft offering similar services, but have you actually tried them? Google App Engine? Please, it's a joke compared to AWS. And Microsoft Azure? Don't even get me started. People might say they like these alternatives, but honestly, most of them have probably never even given AWS a chance. And don't even get me started on IBM Cloud. It's a complete joke. So before you come on here trying to defend AWS and act like they're the best thing since sliced bread, maybe you should do some actual research. Just saying.
------
Alright, let's get one thing straight. This whole game is just plain stupid and a waste of time. But hey, since you're so hell-bent on making pointless claims, I'll indulge you for a moment.

First off, yeah, most government employees have bosses. No kidding Sherlock. Most people in any job have bosses, that's how the whole employment thing works. It's not some mind-blowing revelation. And you're acting like Trump is this almighty CEO who reigns supreme over everyone in the executive branch. Please, give me a break. Do you really think he has that much control? He's just one person among thousands of government employees, and trust me, they don't all answer to him directly.

And what's with this whole "Republicans control 99.999% of government" nonsense? Are you seriously that clueless? Political parties may have their influence, but there are plenty of checks and balances in place to ensure no one party has complete control. So, kindly get your facts straight before spewing out such baseless claims.

In conclusion, your little game is a joke, just like your understanding of how the government actually works. Stop trying to oversimplify things and maybe educate yourself before posting such drivel.
------
Yo, can we please stop acting like someone is telling you how to play the damn game? Like, seriously, we all have different preferences and that's cool. I personally love games like D2, POE, and GD because they have a different approach than D3. And that's fine.

But here's the thing, the rules in any game are just made up. They affect the outcome, whether you like it or not. So, when you say customization is just customization, with or without permanency, yeah, you might be right. But permanency adds a whole different feel to the game that you just can't get without it.

Take hardcore mode, for example. Why even have it if you can just start a new character and delete it and all their stuff when they die? It's basically the same thing, right? Nope. The feeling of permanent death is what makes hardcore mode intense for those players.

For me, having a bunch of skill combinations and being able to change them whenever feels like having no build diversity at all. It's like having loadouts in COD. It defeats the purpose of character building in my opinion.

I know it's hard to explain, but even I used to defend D3's customization system and how it didn't matter if choices were permanent. But after playing games like Grim Dawn and gaining some game dev experience, my mind has been changed. Permanency, or any perception of it, is crucial for the "feel" of the game.

Now the big question is, if there's a new Diablo game, will they go the D3 route so people like you don't feel punished when choosing skills? Or will they lean more towards games like Grim Dawn, where players like me actually feel like we're playing an RPG with character progression and building? Guess we'll have to wait and see.
------
Honestly, I don't get what you're saying. Adding all that crap to a plane just so it can fly without a pilot? Are you serious? It's a waste of space and weight. And let's not forget about the extra costs for life support and all that fancy ejection system. Plus, if you go pilotless, you can kiss goodbye your ability to out-turn any enemy plane. Yeah, no more pilot blackout advantage. And what if the damn thing gets shot down? You lose all that combat experience from the pilot, genius. 

But hey, I guess the F-35 guys thought about all that and decided it was too risky. Maybe they were right, with all the electronic warfare and shit. Still, it's fun to think about the pros and cons of both systems. Who knows, maybe one day we'll have badass pilotless planes flying around. But for now, let's stick to having real pilots kicking ass up there.
------
Alright, so this might get me some hate, but whatever. I gotta say, I'm not really digging this roster. Like, seriously? Angela? Valkyrie? Sif? The Warriors Three? And don't even get me started on Heimdall. Who the hell thought these guys were a good fit for this team?

But hey, I'll give them props for at least going up against a villain from the Guardians of the Galaxy. That's a nice touch, keeping with the whole "Guardians" thing. And let's not forget that they still have to deal with those pesky Asgardian threats. Gotta love that.

Now, let's talk about that kid Loki reveal. What the actual hell?! Wasn't he supposed to be the sweet, innocent version of Loki? The one who actually cared about people? So why the hell is he suddenly all power-hungry and obsessed with the weapons Nebula is stealing? It just doesn't make sense, man.
------
Dude, I get where you're coming from, but I gotta disagree with you on this one. I don't think Jon's gonna lead any party north for Bran. That's just wishful thinking, bro. I mean, who even thinks about gorns path these days? It's like ancient history, man.

And seriously, what's up with all the cave talk? Jon and Ygritte in a cave doesn't mean he knows where to find Bran. That's a stretch, my dude. Plus, have you seen the freaking snow up there? It's insane! Ain't no way they can go traipsing through that like it's a walk in the park.

Let's be real here, there's probably some other character we've never even heard of who's gonna show up and lead them through some secret underground tunnel. That's how these stories work, man. Always throwing us curveballs.

But hey, that's just my two cents. We'll just have to wait and see what the show throws at us next, right? Cheers!
------
Yo, so here's the deal. If you're a casual Minecraft player like me and you want to play with your friends on consoles and phones, you gotta go with the bedrock edition. It's the only one that's cross-platform and all that jazz. But let me tell you, the real stuff happens with the Java edition, my dude.

See, Java edition is for the PC master race. You can't connect to bedrock servers, but who needs 'em when you got all the good shit in the Java edition? I'm talking about mods, resource packs, plugins, you name it. And the best part? It's all free, baby!

But hold up, bedrock edition has this stupid store where you gotta pay for everything. Like seriously, who wants to spend money on modifications? Not me, that's for sure. I don't even know if they have those dope mods that completely change the game in bedrock, 'cause I never bothered with that money-grabbing store.

So yeah, micro-transactions are a total deal-breaker for me. I'll stick to my free Java edition and enjoy all the sweet mods without emptying my wallet. Peace out!
------
Honestly, I don't get why the Democrats are throwing such a fit over Kavanaugh's confirmation. It takes forever for these justices to get confirmed anyway, so what's the big deal? Plus, they're just trying to flex their muscles before the midterms - typical political move.

But seriously, did you see how they were acting even before any of these allegations came out? It's like they were desperately trying to find something, anything, to stop this guy from getting confirmed. All that insanity during the hearings just makes me think that false accusations are totally possible here.

I mean, I get it, they don't want another conservative justice on the Supreme Court. But come on, let's be real, they're not fooling anyone with their outrage. It's all just a bunch of political grandstanding. Can we please get back to focusing on actual issues instead? Ugh!
------
Okay, seriously, what the hell is wrong with some people? I mean, how can anyone even compare a stupid cake to that batshit crazy Alex Jones? Are you for real? The baker doesn't want to write a freaking word on a cake and you have the audacity to equate that to supporting a scumbag who spreads lies, harasses innocent people, and preys on grieving parents? Are you high or just plain delusional? The baker's decision may be based on some religious belief (which is still dumb in my opinion), but at least it's not driven by greed and a sick desire to manipulate and deceive for profit. Supporting Alex Jones is like endorsing a professional con artist. Seriously, don't even try to defend that madman. We're better off without his bullshit.
------
Yo, did anyone else ever think about how Idiocracy only shows us this messed up version of America? Like, what if it's just some exaggerated, idiotic future America and the rest of the world is actually chillin' in a utopia? Maybe all those other countries are just raking in the cash off our stupidity.

I mean, it's not like other nations trapped us or anything. It's more like America just went downhill real fast, and the other countries were like, "Well, we can let them self-destruct or we can profit off their dumbasses." So they planted these puppet CEOs to make it seem like we were still running the show.

Idiocracy is a freakin' masterpiece, but I can't help but wonder what would've happened in a sequel. Maybe Joe, as the new prez, would've been curious about the rest of the world and stumbled upon some crazy conspiracy. And you know there'd be some intense internal drama too, especially with Upgrayedd coming out of that time capsule at the end.

Man, I wish they made a sequel. But maybe it's better left untouched.
------
Honestly, it's so damn ridiculous how these right-wing nutjobs are so damn selective about their precious constitutional rights. They scream and cry about wanting Facebook and Twitter to protect their First Amendment rights, but they don't give a flying fart about churches protecting anyone's rights. Like seriously, these churches are getting government funds, but they think they can just do whatever the hell they want. Hypocrisy much?

I mean, let's get real here. Constitutional rights are something the damn government owes you, not your neighbor or some random person on the street. Individuals have the freaking freedom to discriminate all they damn well please, unless they're an organization that's funded by the government. And yet, these right-wing jerks have the nerve to say that making churches protect people's rights is violating their precious religious rights. But hey, they have no heartburn demanding that the government forces Facebook and Twitter to protect their precious First Amendment rights.

So, in conclusion, the whole post from this right-wing shill is just a big bag of irony. Can you smell it? I sure can.

Hey fellow Redditors! Just wanted to drop a quick line here to shamelessly self-promote my music channel on Twitch called Safehouse. Yeah, that's right, shame-less self-promotion incoming! We've got this weekly show featuring not just one, not even two, but four different bands from Austin, Texas, all from different genres! It's like a freakin' music buffet up in here!

And let me tell you, it's not just about the tunes, but the whole damn package. We make sure our stream looks good and sounds good, because we're professionals, ya know? If you're into music on Twitch, we desperately need more eyeballs on this channel. Seriously, we're begging here. Help us grow and discover some seriously cool music.

Unfortunately, we can only manage to stream weekly, but don't worry, we've got you covered. We play our favorite sets throughout the day when we're not live. Trust me, some seriously good stuff comes through. So, do yourself a favor and check us out at twitch.tv/safehouse. You won't regret it. Thanks, y'all!

Ugh, I don't get why people are so worked up about buying the living world episodes. Like seriously, if you didn't log in during the few months it was free, tough luck. It's not like they owe you anything. And don't even get me started on Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire. Yeah, they were pricey, but what did you expect? Good things ain't cheap, my friend.

And those boosters? Ain't pay-to-win at all. I've been playing for over 3 freaking years and never spent a dime on them. XP boosters are only useful if you're in a hurry to level up your masteries, so suck it up and grind like the rest of us. As for magic find boosters, yeah, some might call it pay-to-win, but seriously, it doesn't even affect most of the game. Plus, you can get them for free if you just log in daily.

Now let's talk about those dye pack lootboxes. Yeah, they suck, I won't deny that. But guess what? You can buy every single dye on the trading post. And recently, they've been rotating the packs in and out of the black lion chest, which means you can grab those dyes that used to cost a fortune for super cheap. So stop complaining and go buy your dyes like the rest of us. Oh, and they even give away the paid dyes in birthday gifts, so there you go. Stop whining already.
------
Look, I get it. People have their opinions, and that's fine. But seriously, claiming that being against same-sex relationships is not bigoted or bullying? Come on, man. It's 2021, not the dark ages. Love is love, no matter who it's between. If you think it's unnatural for two guys or two girls to be together, then sorry, but that is closed-minded as hell. And spare me the whole "Christians are being bullied" nonsense. Just because people call out hate speech and discrimination doesn't mean they're trying to silence anyone. It's about standing up for what's right. So, yeah, maybe take a step back and reevaluate your opinion. It's not about someone's bad experience, it's about equality and respecting everyone's right to love who they want.
------
Hey everyone, just wanted to give you an update on the post my brother made a while back. Unfortunately, things didn't turn out so well. He actually ended up taking his own life. Yeah, I know, it's some heavy shit.

I did everything I could to try and help him, but it just wasn't enough. He was completely destroyed after his girlfriend left him, lost a ton of weight, and stopped eating. I even got him professional help, like you guys suggested, but it didn't do jack shit. I thought he was getting better, but then he decided to stop going to therapy. And now he's gone.

I found him hanging in our house. It was a nightmare, man. He left a letter saying thank you to everyone who supported him, which includes you guys. So yeah, thanks for trying to help, I guess.

To those of you saying this is fake, fuck off. This is a real story, a real tragedy. It's messed up, but shit like this does happen. So if you were one of the people who actually showed some sympathy, thank you. Your kind words meant something. The rest of you can go screw yourselves.

That's all I wanted to say. Peace out.

Are you seriously trying to argue that religion is just as valid as science? Come on, man! Science is based on evidence and facts, while religion is just a bunch of fairy tales and superstitions. I mean, seriously, how has believing in Zeus or Quetzalcoatl brought us any useful knowledge or discoveries? Spoiler alert: it hasn't! 

With science, we can actually understand and explain reality. We can make reliable, testable, and observable predictions. Can religion do that? Nope, didn't think so. Living a life without religion means we're not shackled by ancient dogmas and can explore the wonders of the universe freely. We don't need to warp reality to fit some ridiculous religious beliefs. We can ask questions, investigate, and seek the truth. So, yeah, religion might be comforting for some people, but let's not pretend it's as valid as science. It's time to embrace reason and logic, my friend.

Hey, kid troubles, am I right? Well, listen up because I'm about to drop some truth bombs on you. First off, forget about all those fancy martial arts styles. At 8 years old, it doesn't really matter which one he picks. Just find a place that's not a daycare dojo or a Cobra Kai wannabe.

Now, if you want to mold this kid into a decent human being, you gotta find some role models for him. None of that namby-pamby whining stuff. Get him into superheroes or something. Batman is a solid choice. He never cries when he loses, he just brushes it off and tries again. Teach that kid some resilience, will ya?

Oh, and don't forget about the good ol' local Boy/Cub Scout troops. But be warned, they can be hit or miss depending on the adults in charge. So do your damn research! 

At home, you gotta make the consequences crystal clear. Take away their allowance, for example. Room not clean? Boom, there goes a dollar. Let them know that their behavior has consequences, and that they have control over their own lives. It's all about choices, man. Show them where they messed up, so they know they have the option not to be little sh*ts.

Alright, that's enough parenting advice from me. Good luck, dude!
------
Bruh, let's be real here. Riot ain't gonna do shit to fix this Udyr mess they got themselves into. Like, who even plays Udyr anymore? He's like a relic from the Stone Age. But if they really wanna salvage this shitshow, they better make SG Udyr the default skin and drop a sick new ultimate skin for him. And listen up Riot, if you actually pull this off, you better refund all those chumps who wasted their RP on that garbage SGU skin. Like, come on, give 'em a chance to spend their hard-earned cash on something worthwhile. I know some diehard Udyr mains might feel like they got shafted, but screw 'em. The only way to fix this mess is to make some serious changes, no half-assed solutions. So yeah, Riot, step up your game and make this happen. But hey, knowing you, I won't hold my breath.
------
Seriously, are we back to the "peoplekind" nonsense again? Are you trying to invent some imaginary scandal by analyzing every single facial expression? Give me a break!

Here's a suggestion: maybe if you guys stopped blaming every crime committed by someone with brown skin on the prime minister, people might take your political opinions seriously. I don't remember anyone demanding Harper to answer for Catholic church child molestations and criticizing him for not shedding tears. Why the double standard?

Instead of focusing so much on virtue signaling and using tragic events to push your agenda, maybe try talking about actual government issues that have nothing to do with pinning child murders on the PM. It's embarrassing and makes your whole political faction look like a bunch of clueless clowns. Can we move on already?
------
Uh, the fact that you're trying to equate progressivism with fascism just shows how little you understand about history and politics. It's like comparing apples to oranges. Sure, fascists may have implemented some progressive policies, but that doesn't make them the same thing. Fascism is an authoritarian ideology built on the oppression of others, while progressivism is about promoting social justice and equality. 

And let's not forget that fascism also involved things like racial superiority, mass genocide, and a cult of personality around their leader. So, no, I don't think any party's policies today sound anything close to fascism. Maybe instead of spreading ignorant and inflammatory comparisons, you should actually take the time to educate yourself on what these ideologies truly represent. But hey, what do I know? I'm just a casual Reddit user trying to enjoy my scrolling without seeing this kind of nonsense.

Wow, your family really fucked up by ignoring the issue and leaving it for others to handle. It's not your teacher's or principal's job to babysit your family and inform them about your problems. That's something your parents should have taken care of privately and then let the school know. So, don't blame others for your family's incompetence.

And yeah, I get it, I mentioned teachers, but it applies to everyone. Nobody wants to hear about their shortcomings in such a direct and blunt way. It's like pointing out the elephant in the room – totally rude. If someone needs to bring up a touchy subject, like your kid being autistic and having trouble socially, there are better ways to do it. Saying "your autistic son sucks at socializing" is just plain disrespectful. How about saying "your kid is having a hard time fitting in with the other students"? It's a more polite way to start a difficult conversation.

But seriously, your family needs to take responsibility and stop expecting everyone else to clean up their mess.
------
Listen, mate, I think you're missing the point here. The whole idea of a virgin birth is that it's supposed to be something miraculous, right? But let's face it, gods getting it on with mortal women is nothing new. It's like they've got a fetish for impregnating humans in the most bizarre ways possible. So calling Jesus' birth a virgin birth just seems like a cheap imitation, don't you think?

And don't even get me started on this whole resurrection thing. Forty days of hanging out with his disciples before going to heaven? That's not what I call a legit resurrection. I mean, if he really came back from the dead, shouldn't he have made a grand entrance or something? This whole story just seems fishy to me.

Seriously, are you just here to stir the pot and start arguments? Because that's what it feels like. If you've got something new and interesting to say, I'm all ears. But until then, stop wasting our time with these half-assed ideas.
------
I mean, seriously, are you even listening to yourself? Comparing guns to cars and knives? That's like comparing apples to oranges, my dude. Guns are specifically designed to kill, plain and simple. Yeah, sure, some people use them for hunting or self-defense, but let's be real here, most of the time they're used to harm others. So yeah, maybe we should actually try to keep them out of the hands of crazy people. I'm not saying take away every single gun on the planet, but come on, there has to be some common sense regulation. It's not about taking away your precious rifles or shotguns, it's about making sure that the wrong people don't have access to weapons of mass destruction. So quit whining about your rights being infringed upon and start thinking about the safety of everyone else. Peace out.
------
Look, I get what you're saying about addiction and all, but holding people accountable for possessing hard drugs is just common sense. Like, why should they get away with it? I think rehab is a decent punishment for possession, at least for the first few times. But if they keep screwing up and rehab doesn't work, then they deserve more than just a slap on the wrist.

Sure, we need more rehab centers and they should do a better job, no doubt about it. But come on, people need to take responsibility for themselves too. They can't just rely on rehab to fix everything. They gotta show some damn willpower and make an effort to stay clean.

That's why we need the criminal element involved. If these drug users know that jail time is a possibility, they might actually take rehab seriously. It's not about absolving them of responsibility, it's about giving them a wake-up call.

And don't even get me started on the whole "if they don't harm anyone else" argument. I mean, seriously? We can't just wait until they go on a freakin' rampage to do something about it. It's like saying drunk driving shouldn't be a crime unless someone gets hurt. We gotta stop these things before they escalate, man.
------
Alright, fellow Redditors, listen up! I need your help finding some mind-bending movies that will blow my socks off! I'm talking about films with endings so unexpected, it'll leave me questioning my own existence. I want plot twists that are so outrageous, they'll make my brain do a somersault. And hey, if you can suggest something so messed up that it'll haunt my dreams and have me curled up in my bed shaking, all the better!

Now, I don't care if these movies are critically acclaimed masterpieces or complete dumpster fires. As long as they make me think, I'm all in. It could be a new release or an old classic that flew under the radar – I don't discriminate. So hit me with your craziest, most mind-altering recommendations, Reddit. Let's blow my freaking mind!
------
Wow, talk about an insecure and petty jerk! It's clear that this person has some major issues if they feel the need to bring you down instead of being supportive. I mean, seriously, who does that? Venting is a normal part of life, and a good partner should be there to listen and offer some kind of comfort or advice, not use it as an opportunity to make you feel worse.

I can't help but wonder if this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this guy's behavior. If he acts like this over something so trivial, how would he react in a more serious situation? It's definitely concerning, to say the least.

Personally, I wouldn't trust someone like that. Trust is a crucial foundation in any relationship, and if he can't even handle a simple vent session without turning it into his personal power trip, then it's time for some serious reevaluation. You deserve someone who supports and uplifts you, not someone who tears you down. Don't settle for this immature nonsense!
------
Wow, you really need to wake up and take off those rose-colored glasses. It's clear as day that you have no clue what you're talking about when it comes to infant circumcision. The majority of doctors don't support it, so what does that tell you? Maybe you should stop living in denial and get yourself educated on the subject.

And don't even get me started on the links you provided. It's obvious they have a hidden agenda. They try to act all neutral and pretend to give information, but it's just a load of crap. They even admit that there isn't enough data to recommend routine circumcisions. So why the hell are so many babies being cut up then? Where's the proof that it's beneficial?

And let's not forget about the money-grabbing doctors who push for this unnecessary procedure. They claim it's the parents' choice, but they conveniently leave out the fact that they'll happily cash in on the whole thing. It's all about profit for them.

So go ahead and keep living in your ignorant bubble, but don't expect the rest of us to join you. We'll stick to facts and common sense, thank you very much.
------
Honestly, I think you've got it all wrong. The whole point of the sin war is that it's a battle between heaven and hell, and yeah, it's supposed to be an epic battle of good vs evil. That's what makes it so damn exciting! Who wants to read about humanity's vulnerability and all that depressing crap? I want to see some badass angels and demons kicking each other's asses!

And yeah, I get it, gothic fantasy is all about questioning if good even exists. But come on, that's not what Diablo is about. It's about kicking demon ass and saving the world! I don't need some deep, philosophical storyline. I just want to have fun and slay some monsters.

And don't even get me started on the endings of Diablo 1 and 2. Yeah, they were impactful, but in a super depressing way. I don't want evil to win, man. I want the heroes to triumph and save the day.

So yeah, I totally disagree with you. Diablo 3 did a great job with its lore and making it more epic and high fantasy. I don't need constant unrest and darkness. I just want to have a good time playing a kickass game.
------
Wow, dude, I get that you're trying to be all understanding and stuff, but seriously, who gives a damn about her stupid health problems? Like, sex is important, man! If she's not in the mood, she needs to figure it out and get over herself. It's not like she's the only one dealing with pain or whatever. We all have our own issues, but that doesn't mean we have to let them ruin our sex lives. She just needs to suck it up and give her boyfriend what he wants. It's not rocket science, bro. I mean, if she can't handle a little discomfort for the sake of their relationship, maybe they shouldn't even be together. So, my advice to OP is simple: dump her and find someone who actually cares about your needs.
------
Seriously, dude? You really think this crapcoin was listed on CMC right after its launch? Get real. It's like a pattern with these forks, they always shoot up in value at the beginning because only the lucky ones who had coins on the exchanges could sell. And guess what? Most of these so-called "forks" are just some imaginary coins that never even exist. I remember when I sold my Bitcoin File and Bitcoin God for a measly 4% profit each, and guess what? Those suckers never even launched! And don't get me started on this BCash Gold thing. I managed to sell it for 0.2BTC on HitBTC on the day it launched. These people buying these forks have no idea what they're getting themselves into.
------
Dude, I gotta vent about this one time I tried making hard cider. Let me tell you, it was a straight-up disaster. I mean, I had the most janky equipment you could imagine - like seriously, I'm talking duct tape and old buckets. It was a total ghetto setup, and needless to say, the end result was absolutely disgusting.

I took one sip of that homemade cider, and I swear I almost puked. It tasted like fermented cat pee or something. I have no idea what went wrong, but let's just say my dreams of becoming the next craft cider master quickly fizzled out.

Props to my buddy though, he's got his beer game on point. This dude hasn't even finished college yet, but his brews are legit. I'm talking Sierra Nevada level, and that's saying something. He's got that passion, man, and I honestly wouldn't be surprised if he becomes a pro brewer someday. Passion beats money any day, my friends.
------
Wow, I just stumbled upon your edit. Just to make things crystal clear for you, ALL off-site Pokemon are blocked from being traded here. And that includes any Pokemon that we haven't even bothered to ask about! We've seen enough evidence from your chats to come to this conclusion. Even if you did manage to ask all the right questions once upon a blue moon, sorry buddy, but we just can't trust you anymore. There have been too many instances where you've been careless as hell on this subreddit. We don't have the time or energy to verify every single thing you offer from off-site.

Oh, and by the way, you can try appealing this ridiculous restriction in the future, once you've grown some brains and learned how to trade safely. But guess what? Anything you obtained before that glorious day will not be allowed to be traded here. So tough luck, pal.

Hope that clears things up for ya.
------
Dude, why are you making such a big deal about fact-checking someone's Java skills? Like seriously, who cares if they can talk Java or not? I mean, if they can show that they've got some legit self-study stuff going on, like a Duolingo account or some verification from a respected institution, then that's cool. But honestly, your question is kinda dumb. It sounds like you're just trying to play some stats game or something. And let me tell you, that's not the kind of person I'd want to hire. So quit being so uptight and just focus on finding someone who's actually interested in the project and has the skills to back it up. Geez!
------
Honestly, I don't get why people are even discussing this responsibility crap. Like seriously, who cares? In the example you gave, if someone is bleeding out in a room and no one helps, it's just messed up. But I don't see how math or percentages are gonna change anything. How about instead of arguing about responsibility, we focus on being decent human beings and helping each other out?

And why are we even trying to compute responsibility? Is there some fancy formula for that now? Do we need a responsibility calculator or something? Give me a break. If you see someone in trouble, just do something about it instead of trying to figure out how much responsibility you have. It's called empathy, people. Let's not complicate things with stupid calculations and just be there for each other, alright?
------
Lol, damn, I gotta say, I was wrong about quite a few things here. First off, this prank must've cost them a pretty penny, like over 100 bucks just on materials alone, not to mention the time they put into it. I did predict that they'd use a quick adhesive though, so props to me for that. And can we talk about how they actually got a legit McD's t-shirt? That was some next level dedication right there, and it's probably why no one even noticed them putting up the poster. I gotta admit, I thought that part would've been way harder. But hey, I was off about the poster quality, thought it would've been heavier and fallen down by now. Guess I underestimated it. Now, here's the real funny thing about this whole prank, the poster is all about lack of diversity. And guess what? No Mexicans in sight! Maybe we should put up another one just to mess with 'em. Haha, only time will tell what Mickey D's gonna do about it. Bet they'll take it down or maybe even contact the pranksters for some sweet promo.
------
Wow, you really have no idea what you're talking about. It's clear that you're just regurgitating the same old liberal propaganda without actually thinking for yourself. Immigration is not some magical solution to all of Europe's problems. Yes, accepting more refugees might make some bleeding-heart liberals feel good about themselves, but it won't magically make everything better.

And don't even get me started on the economy. These refugees are draining resources and taking jobs away from hardworking citizens. And what about the cultural impact? You can't just ignore the fact that a massive influx of refugees can lead to all sorts of social issues and tensions.

So before you go spouting off your ill-informed opinions, maybe take a step back and actually think about the real consequences of open borders and unlimited immigration. It's not as simple as you make it out to be, and your naivety is showing.
------
Honestly, I don't get all the hype around this game. Sure, it has some cool comic book references and the combat is okay, but it's nothing groundbreaking. The stealth mechanics feel like a straight-up ripoff of Batman games, and the boss battles are just frustrating. They force you into a specific playstyle and if you deviate from that, get ready to get your ass kicked. 

I'm playing on easy and still finding it difficult, which is just ridiculous. And don't even get me started on the open world. Yeah, it's kinda accurate to New York, but it feels so empty and lifeless. The voice acting and graphics might be top-notch, but that doesn't make up for the lackluster gameplay.

To be honest, I think people are just blinded by their love for superheroes. The limitations of the superhero genre are definitely holding this game back. Don't waste your money on it unless you're a diehard fan.
------
Look, I don't know where you're getting your information from, but it's clear you haven't done your research. Steel and glass production can absolutely be powered by solar energy. There are already plenty of examples around the world where heavy industries are successfully using solar power. And no, they don't just magically generate heat from thin air, they have ways to generate the heat needed without relying on fossil fuels.

Steel plants, for instance, use natural gas and coke for heat, not grid electricity. And guess what? That natural gas can be replaced with renewables, like I mentioned earlier. There are new techniques like electrolysis and hydrogen that are already being implemented in the steel industry. Plus, there's also the option of using bio-waste to create renewable gas.

So before you make ignorant statements, do some actual research. The Swedes, Danes, and Brits are already looking into these alternatives. Yeah, it might not be as cheap as burning fossil fuels, but hey, what about the environment? That's why a carbon tax is necessary, my friend.
------
Honestly, I don't see this ever happening. Microsoft has a bad reputation that's gonna stick, no matter what. And until those higher-ups who actually make the tech decisions move on, we're not gonna see any changes. 

Sure, c# might be better for developers, but Java keeps getting better with every new release. It's catching up, mate. 

I mean, I've been an engineer using c# for ages and I really like it. But let's be real, NuGet can't even compare to Gradle or Maven. It's like comparing a baby toy to a state-of-the-art tool. And when it comes to frameworks and libraries, anything outside of Microsoft is just poor quality. 

Java, on the other hand, has that enterprise goodness. And building web services? Not a major pain in the butt like with c#. 

And dude, it's 2018! There are so many languages out there that can handle most enterprise needs. C# is just one of them, and honestly, it's not the best choice.
------
WOW, this person really doesn't get it! Can't believe they're going on and on about some hypothetical god lifting rocks and being all-loving. It's like they think they're so smart with their "logic" and "theories." News flash, buddy, theories don't prove anything, especially when it comes to gods.

And what's with the whole black and white thing? Yeah, no kidding things can't be both black and white at the same time. But who cares? We're talking about god here, not colors! Get your head out of the clouds!

And then they bring up trains and bullets. Like what the heck does that have to do with anything? Just because something is logical doesn't mean it exists. Duh! Can't believe I wasted my time reading this nonsense.

Seriously, save your breath next time, buddy. No one wants to hear your half-baked ideas about gods and existence. Stick to something you actually know about, if that's even possible.
------
Yeah, I totally get what you're saying. It's like, who wouldn't be down for some crazy stuff if it's Drake we're talking about, right? That dude is a legend. But still, it's kinda sketchy if you don't really know the person. I mean, you gotta be careful out there, especially with young girls. We all know there are some messed up people out there taking advantage of others. And yeah, it's all about intentions, like if both parties are just having fun and on the same page, then cool. But man, that age difference can be a red flag. There's a reason why the law is there, you know? It's to protect people from getting hurt or manipulated. So, I say be cautious, people!
------
Hey, so I saw your question and thought I'd give you a quick rundown. Propofol and ketamine are pretty different in how they work. Propofol works by increasing the GABA stimulation in your body, while ketamine blocks the NMDA receptors that cause excitement in your central nervous system. We don't know exactly how ketamine works, but we know it does this for sure.

When it comes to clinical use, ketamine has some advantages over propofol in certain situations. Propofol can lower your blood pressure and even cause you to stop breathing at high doses, plus it doesn't have any pain-killing properties. On the other hand, ketamine can increase your heart rate and blood pressure, make you produce lots of saliva, and is really good at relieving pain. Both can cause amnesia at lower doses. Ketamine is especially useful in cases like cardiac tamponade, where keeping patients breathing is super important.

As for the whole life-threatening situation thing, we're trained for that. Anesthesia is all about using our tools to keep you safe and handle emergencies. We work in teams and always call for help when needed. And don't worry, patients aren't always awake right after a procedure. It depends on a bunch of factors. Hope this helps you out!
------
I seriously can't believe some people want to ban selling tickets above face value. Are you kidding me? Do you even understand how economics work? I buy season tickets for my local NBA team precisely because I know I can sell them for a profit when the big games roll in. It's basic supply and demand, dude.

Sure, some games end up selling for less than face value, but that's just the risk you take. You win some, you lose some. If I can't make it to a crappy game and have to unload the tickets, tough luck for me. But then I'll just make up for it when the Lakers or the Celtics come to town and I can charge an arm and a leg for those hot tickets.

But if they implement your stupid policy, where I can only sell tickets for face value, it completely screws over people like me who are just trying to enjoy some damn basketball. I'm not here to make a fortune, but I also don't want to get screwed over by going to 41 games a year. So think before you spout off your dumb ideas and realize they affect real fans too.
------
Wow, I can't believe how messed up everything is. The government is so corrupt on every issue, it's pathetic. They don't give a damn about us regular folks, all they care about is lining the pockets of their rich buddies. Just look at how they treat their own citizens! They sanction people left and right, making it impossible for them to find work, just so their pals in private companies like Capita, G4S, and Atos can make a fortune off our misery. And don't even get me started on their stance on wildlife conservation. They'll let innocent animals get killed just to please some millionaire landowners. 

But what really gets me heated is their attempt to privatize our NHS. They want to hand our healthcare system over to greedy assholes like Richard Branson. Can you believe that? They're selling out our health just to make a quick buck. And let's not forget about the hypocrisy when it comes to drugs. They'll protect the alcohol and tobacco industries, but god forbid they even consider legalizing cannabis or any other drug. Why? Because their base is a bunch of narrow-minded old farts who think weed is the devil. It's a joke!

Honestly, with this medieval bunch of backward corrupt cretins in charge, we'll never see any real change. Legalization of cannabis or anything else will remain a pipe dream.
------
Alright, let's talk about this whole healthcare thing. I mean, seriously? People say it's a human right, but come on! How the hell is it a right when it means someone else has to provide it for you? That's just taking away their freedom and shoving it in your face.

I get it, we all want to be healthy and have access to medical care. But expecting it to be handed to you on a silver platter? That's just lazy entitlement if you ask me. If healthcare is a right, then I guess we should all be forced to become doctors or nurses or whatever, because otherwise we're violating someone's "right" to healthcare. Give me a break!

Let's get real here. Human rights are things that we should all have no matter what, even if we're stuck on a freakin' deserted island. Life, liberty, freedom of speech - those are real rights. But healthcare? Nah, that's just wishful thinking. So quit whining about it and take some damn personal responsibility for your own health. It's not rocket science!
------
Honestly, I don't get why people are always whining about there being too many frickin' guns and attachments in games these days. Like seriously, can't you just be grateful for the options and variety? It's not like anyone is forcing you to use every single damn gun or attachment in the game. If you don't like it, just stick to your precious little pistol or whatever. 

And don't even get me started on the whole balancing issue. Yeah, sure, some attachments might be a little unbalanced, but isn't that part of what makes gaming fun? Figuring out the best combos and wrecking your opponents? It's called strategy, people! So instead of crying about there being too many guns, maybe start crying about how you suck at the game and can't figure out how to make the most out of all these amazing options. 

But hey, what do I know? I'm just a casual Reddit user who enjoys actually having choices in my games. So keep complaining, I guess, while the rest of us have a blast with all the epic weapons and attachments. Peace out, haters!

Damn, dogs are way more aware of their surroundings than we give them credit for. I don't have any kids, but I got this badass boxer pit mix and we take care of foster kittens. Let me tell you, this dog is like a freaking babysitter. Even when those little furballs are climbing all over him, he doesn't even flinch. One time, I accidentally stepped on his paw so hard that it probably hurt like a bitch. But this beast didn't budge, man. He just yelped a bit and kept those damn kittens on his back, like he knew they were in danger if he moved too suddenly.

I guess it's no surprise when you think about it. Those tiny puppies are fragile as hell, and dogs have been around for ages. They've evolved to protect the next generation and not squish 'em like bugs. It's pretty damn cool if you ask me. Dogs are smarter than we give 'em credit for, man.
------
Dude, I totally get what you're going through. I had the same damn problem with my parents when I picked a major they didn't approve of. It sucked, but it motivated me to prove them wrong. I busted my ass, got good grades, did a bunch of internships, and ended up landing a sweet job with a legit company. But you know what? My mom still won't shut up about how she knows best. It's effing annoying.

But hey, here's my advice to you, OP. Screw what they think. Focus on yourself and your career. You gotta take charge of your own life, man. If you have to take out student loans or work extra jobs to make it happen, then do it. Four years might seem like a long time, but trust me, it'll fly by. And while you're at it, get as much experience as you can. Do internships, make connections with professors and peers, and learn from criticism. Don't give up, bro. Having a degree opens up so many doors for your future.

Oh, and by the way, congrats on crushing that exam! Keep that momentum going, my friend. Keep on pushing forward.
------
Dude, seriously? Are you even reading what you're saying? Your whole argument is a freaking joke! Yeah, sure, you heard both sides, but it seems like you conveniently forgot to actually comprehend anything. It's like you're blind to all the insults and flaming that's going on here. And don't even get me started on how you're completely ignoring people's actual points.

Oh, great, you're from the Philippines and have Chinese blood. Congratulations, I guess? But being some self-proclaimed expert doesn't automatically make you right. I don't care about your fancy education or your time abroad. It doesn't make your opinion any more valid than anyone else's.

So, let me get this straight, you think the police are innocent angels? Are you out of your damn mind? They have a freaking history of planting evidence and killing innocent people! It's all over the news! Even freaking tourists and foreigners have been caught in their crooked web. And guess what? They get away with it! So, forgive me if I don't buy their story this time. It's hard to believe a bunch of liars and murderers, especially now. Open your eyes, man!
------
Alright, seriously? Are you kidding me with this post? I mean, come on, how dense can you be? It's not rocket science to figure out how to format a damn post. Did you even bother to use your brain before typing? Clearly not.

And don't give me that "open to interpretation" crap. Are you seriously trying to blame your inability to follow basic formatting rules on some kind of creative freedom? Give me a break. Maybe instead of wasting everyone's time with your whiny excuses, you should actually read the site rules like a responsible adult.

I swear, some people just have no common sense. It's like they were born under a rock or something. Next time, please spare us all the headache and put a little effort into your posts. Is that too much to ask? Apparently, for some people, it is. Ugh.

Alright, listen up, folks. I'm about to drop some truth bombs on you. Bullshit jobs. Yeah, they exist. But guess what? They ain't gonna last forever. Companies are like those gym rats who bulk up and cut down. It's all about cycles, my friends.

Now, when your company is in the growth phase, you don't wanna be all stingy with your cash. You gotta spend money to make money, right? So you let the inefficiencies pile up like dirty laundry. And trust me, there's some dead wood in there too.

But then comes the fun part. It's time for a good ol' burn, baby! You trim the fat, cut out the dead weight, and try to keep as much moolah coming in as possible. It's like a cleanse for your company.

So stop whining about those bullshit jobs, okay? They'll go away eventually. Just hang in there, and before you know it, your company will be back on that growth train, ready to take on the world.

Ugh, I totally get what you're saying about Grapes of Wrath. Seriously, the Joad family is so damn boring. Like, who cares about their struggles and all that crap? The only good parts of the book are when Steinbeck actually focuses on something else. I mean, that whole quote you mentioned about the bank and everything, that's where the real genius is! It's like, yeah, the bank might be made up of dudes, but it's this frickin' monster that can't be tamed. That shit is deep.

But let me tell you, if you really want to read a Steinbeck book that's actually worth your time, go for East of Eden. Honestly, it blows Grapes of Wrath out of the freakin' water. It's got more interesting characters and a way better storyline. Trust me on this one, bro. East of Eden is where it's at.

Are you kidding me? Two working adults earning only 30k each? That's pathetic! No wonder people are struggling to make ends meet. How the hell are they supposed to support a family or even have a decent life with that kind of income? And don't even get me started on the cost of living these days. Rent, insurance, healthcare, it's all skyrocketing while our wages stay stagnant. It's a damn joke. And don't give me that "gain experience" crap either. It's just an excuse for employers to underpay us and exploit our hard work. We deserve better than this. Society needs to wake the hell up and start valuing its workers instead of just squeezing every last penny out of us. Enough is enough.
------
Man, I gotta say, this whole waiting game for a new game announcement is getting old real quick. I mean, seriously, every damn year that passes without any official news just adds another year of torture to us fans. And what's with Blizzard being so tight-lipped about it? We can't even get a hint or a whisper of what's going on behind the scenes. It's like they enjoy keeping us in the dark, sitting here with our thumbs up our asses while they take their sweet time.

Sure, a Diablo 4 reveal would give us some sort of relief, but let's be real here, it's just gonna mean more waiting. Like, are we really supposed to go through a few more years of anticipation? It's gonna suck big time, man. But I guess on the bright side, at least we'll know for sure that they're actually working on something, right? Ugh, this whole situation is frustrating as hell. Hurry up, Blizzard, and put us out of our misery already!
------
Alright, let's get real here. I gotta say, the automatic wipers in this car are pretty damn sweet. No more messing around with those stupid wiper settings, just set it and forget it. And don't even get me started on the vents - they're like little magical air machines. Seriously, it's like having your own personal climate control wizard in the car. Who needs to manually adjust vents when you can just let the car do all the work?

Now, some people might whine about not being able to mess with the mirrors while driving. But seriously, why the hell would you need to? These babies are smart enough to adjust themselves when you're reversing. It's like having a personal mirror assistant. And honestly, if you're digging around in the glove box while driving, you've got bigger issues to deal with.

Sure, the touchscreen controls everything, but it's actually not that bad. They've got the important stuff right at the bottom, so a quick touch and boom, you're good to go. And let's be real, other car manufacturers have these puny screens with crappy software that's slower than a snail on sedatives. I once tried to use the navigation in an Acura and it was a goddamn nightmare. So trust me, this car ain't half bad.
------
Hey, what the hell are you talking about? This guy leading the assault and surviving doesn't mean he's automatically written for world-saving crap. Who decides that anyway? Sounds like a load of BS to me.

And seriously, what does it even mean to be "written or molded for world-saving stuff"? You're not making any sense, buddy. Get your thoughts straight before posting this kind of nonsense.

And don't even get me started on the comparison to Rhaenys. Yeah, they might both be good-looking with long silver hair, but that doesn't mean they have some grand destiny to save the freaking world. They're just impulsive and charming people, that's all.

Oh, and by the way, who cares about this ptwp stuff? Only one of the heads needs to be, so why are we even debating if Aegon can still be the prince? It's just a stupid theory anyway. Get over it, dude.
------
Dude, seriously? Who has time to count roach HP and perfectly time their transfuses? I mean, come on! It's not like we're all pro gamers here. Just use some common sense, man. If a roach is at around half health, just go ahead and transfuse it. It's close enough to the max HP that you'll get a decent heal out of it. Yeah, yeah, I get it, in theory, you might want to maximize efficiency and all that crap. But in practice? Ain't nobody got time for that. Just focus on microing your units and stop overthinking it. Plus, let's be real, this transfuse buff is situational as hell anyway. So why are we even arguing about it? Just accept it and move on. And if you can't do it for the roaches, at least do it for the hydras. And don't even get me started on the post-nerf transfuse. Ugh.
------
I mean, come on. Are we really still having this debate? Women have the right to choose whether or not they want to join the army, sure. But that doesn't mean they aren't facing discrimination.

Just because women have the choice doesn't mean they have the same opportunities. Let's be real here. The military is still a male-dominated field. They constantly face sexism and prejudice. And don't even get me started on the pay gap! Women have to work twice as hard to prove themselves.

And what's with this whole biological argument? Yeah, men might be generally physically stronger, but that doesn't mean women can't be badass soldiers. Women are just as capable of handling the job, so why should we limit their opportunities?

And seriously, men being discriminated against? Please. Don't make me laugh. Men have always had the upper hand in society. It's time to level the playing field and give everyone equal chances. So let's stop with this nonsense and support gender equality in the military.
------
So, get this. I was at this lame Korean language exchange thing in my city. Trying to learn some Korean, you know? Anyway, this one person starts asking me if I've ever been to Korea. I'm like, duh, yeah, I was there in 2013. Then they ask where I went, so I mention Busan. And guess what? This person suddenly remembers something and asks me if I was there during some random week. I'm thinking, what's the big deal?

Next thing I know, they whip out their stupid phone and start scrolling through their dumb photos. And what do they pull up? A frickin' picture of them and their boyfriend. But wait for it...they zoom in on the background, and guess who's chillin' there? Me! In their stupid vacation photo!

I mean, seriously, what are the odds? It's freakin' hilarious! Small world, I guess. But damn, talk about a random encounter. Has anything like this ever happened to you guys? Let's hear your crazy coincidences!
------
I don't get why everyone is complaining about the sprint speed in this game. Like, seriously? It's already freaking fast! The whole point of having a sprint option is to use it strategically, not to spam it and zoom around the map like a maniac. So where does it end? Are we gonna have an even faster sprint speed with super stamina next? Or go back to snail-like running speeds without any sprint option at all? Maybe stamina should last for a freaking eternity so you can sprint all day without a break? What do you guys think is best?

Personally, I prefer it this way because it makes PvP easier. I mean, who wants to spend hours chasing after dumb boars when you can just focus on fighting other players? Plus, people who rely too much on sprinting usually get screwed over when they're caught off guard and have to resort to jogging. And don't even get me started on those "intended" joggers. They're just moving slower and easier to hit, in my opinion. So yeah, keep the sprint speed as is, and let the haters hate.

Hey there,

So I gotta be honest, I didn't do much hiking in Bled. I was too busy recovering from a week of headbanging and beer chugging at Metaldays in Tolmin. I mean, can you blame me? But hey, I did hike up to the castle in Bled and it was a pretty cool climb. It was steep as hell, but worth it for the killer view of the castle.

Anyway, I can't give you much advice on hiking around Bled, but I've heard it's awesome. Slovenia in general is just beautiful no matter where you go, so you really can't go wrong. Here's a nice list of paths you could check out.

Now, if you're thinking of doing a day trip from Ljubljana to both Bled and Bohinj, it's gonna be tough to fit everything in. The sun goes down pretty early, so you'll be fighting against time. Personally, I'd recommend staying overnight in either Bled or Bohinj so you don't have to rush everything. Trust me, it'll make your life easier.

Bohinj is worth spending a whole day at, trust me. You can kayak the lake or hike to a badass waterfall. Yeah, there are a crap ton of stairs to get there, but it's worth it, I promise.

As for Vogel, there are a few routes you can take. If you're an experienced hiker, the longest one is about 13.20 km with a bunch of ascent. It takes around 6 hours, but you'll be rewarded with an epic view. Unfortunately, when I went, it started raining like crazy and I couldn't see squat. So, I just turned back.

If you've got more questions, hit me up. I can ask my Slovenian friend for some help too. She's out hiking right now, lucky bitch! But she knows her stuff.

Good luck, dude!

Look, I get it. Life sucks sometimes and people can be real jerks. But you can't expect everyone to jump in and save your sorry ass when things go south. If you can't even stand up for yourself, why would anyone else step in to save you? It's a messed up situation, no doubt about it. Nobody should have to deal with harassment from complete strangers. But standing up for yourself is always a risky move. It's not like in the movies where everyone starts clapping and cheering for the hero. More often than not, the harasser will just get angrier and you'll end up feeling even more frustrated and embarrassed. But here's the thing - if you do stand up for yourself, that jerk will think twice before messing with someone again. It plants a seed of doubt in their pathetic little minds. And hey, sometimes it's best to pick your battles. If things are getting out of hand and violence seems likely, call the damn cops or find a way to deescalate the situation. Don't go putting innocent people's lives at risk. And let's be real here, expecting a random stranger to come and save you from danger is just plain unfair.
------
Look, I'm just gonna say it straight. If my kid decides to do something that I don't agree with and they think it's all fine and dandy, well, tough luck. We clearly won't see eye to eye on this one. But honestly, who cares what I think? My kid answers to God, and so do I.

Now, let's say my kid comes out as gay but still loves God and actually pays attention to what the Bible says about it. You know what? I'd support them however I can. It's all about loving and helping them, right?

The real difference here is that some Christians actually give a damn about what God thinks, while others claim to be Christians but don't really care. If you're gonna call yourself one, expect to be held to a standard that puts God first. That's just how it is, my friend.
------
Lol, who cares if the Earth is a sphere or an oblate spheroid? Like seriously, does it really make a difference in our day-to-day lives? I mean, sure, it's kinda interesting to know that the equator and poles have different circumferences, but come on, we're not gonna lose sleep over this. Plus, I don't know about you, but I've got better things to do than worry about the shape of our planet.

But hey, if you really wanna get technical, here's the deal. The Earth's shape is determined by gravity and centrifugal forces. Gravity pulls everything towards the center, making it more spherical. And then you've got the centrifugal force that pushes everything away from the axis of rotation, messing up that perfect sphere. So, when the Earth spins faster, the equator gets longer and the poles get shorter. And if you go crazy fast, gravity can't hold everything together and boom! Planet goes kaput.

So bottom line, let's just appreciate the fact that we have a cool planet to live on, whether it's a sphere or an oblate spheroid. Can we move on now?
------
Dude, I totally feel you on this. It's like these people have never thought outside the box in their lives. I mean, it's not rocket science, right? Why do they make such a big fuss about walking straight down the aisle when there are so many other ways to get to the other side? It's not like they're judging us like the freakin' French with their point system.

And don't even get me started on the whole armored car analogy. It's like they think we're all a bunch of wannabe thieves or something. Like, seriously? Just because we're figuring out how stupid their rules are doesn't mean we're plotting a hijacking. It's just common sense, man.

Anyway, thanks for bringing this up. It's nice to know that I'm not the only one who sees through this whole airport security charade. Keep fighting the good fight, my friend.
------
I mean, it's not rocket science, right? They want people to stay on their platform for as long as possible, so they push whatever gets the most reactions. And let's face it, anything related to Trump is guaranteed to get people fired up.

But here's the thing, it's not just about the algorithm. It's also about us, the users. We eat this stuff up. We love to argue and vent our frustrations, and what better way to do that than by jumping into a heated political debate?

So yeah, blame the algorithm all you want, but at the end of the day, we're the ones feeding the beast. We're the ones clicking on those posts, leaving angry comments, and getting sucked into the never-ending cycle of outrage.

Maybe instead of pointing fingers, we should take a step back and think about how we're contributing to this madness. Just a thought.
------
Wow, you really have no clue how this works, do you? Government isn't some game where you can just wipe the board clean and start over. When a new administration comes in, they usually honor the agreements made by the previous one, even if they don't like them. That's how it's always been, until we got stuck with clowns like Trump and Ford. These idiots think they can just tear down everything that came before them without consequences. But guess what? That's not how progress is made! If every administration did that, we'd be stuck in a never-ending loop of undoing each other's work. So yeah, good luck to those losers, because they're not gonna last long with that kind of mentality.
------
Well, you're talking about the show, and I'm not so sure about it. But from what I remember, Cersei sends Jaime to kill Olenna Tyrell and take their food and gold. Drogon ends up burning the food, but somehow the gold gets sent ahead and goes unnoticed by Dany and Drogon. This lets her pay off the Iron Bank, and then they decide to loan her even more money. So then she hires the Golden Company and sends Euron to go get them from Essos.

But seriously, Cersei has no claim, no authority, no money, and no army. I guess now she magically has all these things because the writers decided so? I guess they messed up big time. They had to keep her in the story once they got rid of fAegon, but it was a terrible move.

But yeah, I agree with you. Cersei is such an amazing character, and in the show, she deserves way better than this. The fact that she can just pull gold and armies out of her ass is a slap in the face to this epic character.

Because in the books, she's batshit crazy, and Kevan and Pycelle are dead. All that's left are the Tyrells, and she's made enemies out of them. fAegon is gonna come in and wreck shit, and I can't freaking wait for it.
------
Man, let me tell you, teaching school was a joke. I couldn't believe the number of people who were just there because they wanted a "safe" job. You know, like those losers with arts degrees who can't find work in their field. I had to do my student teaching with this girl from the wrong side of town. She just wanted to settle down with her plumber boyfriend and have a boring life in the suburbs. And she was so clueless, always complaining about not knowing about faculty meetings. Maybe if she actually showed up on time instead of slacking off, she would've known. And don't even get me started on her wardrobe. Jeans and hoodies? Seriously? I dressed professionally because I actually respected the students, unlike her. She treated them like idiots and couldn't even comprehend that they were just kids. And let's not forget how she couldn't hold their attention in class. No wonder the education system is going down the drain. They need to raise the entry requirements for teaching degrees. Look at Finland and South Korea, their teachers are top-notch because they have high standards. But of course, our universities are more interested in making money than improving education. I dropped out because I realized teaching sucks. These other students just care about a stable paycheck instead of making a difference.
------
Yo, if you're ever around Jesenice, you gotta check out Bled. Yeah, it's packed with tourists, but there's just something about that damn lake town that makes it better than any other natural beauty spot in the country, in my opinion.

But hey, if you're all about nature and want less of the touristy stuff, head over to Bohinj. It's just a short 30-minute ride away. We thought about taking a taxi to Jesenice and then hopping on a train to Bohinj, but trust me, it ends up costing the same as just taking a taxi the whole way. Even if you're doing that fancy interrail thing, it's worth it. Can't remember the exact price, but there were four of us and we didn't pay more than 10 bucks each, maybe even less.

I haven't personally been to Triglav, but I bumped into some peeps from there in Bohinj and they were raving about how it's even more stunning. So yeah, take that into consideration, bro!
------
Bruh, lemme tell you something real quick. Have you ever heard of the mic on your phone being used as a receiver, not a transmitter? Well, newsflash, it's true. Even when you turn off your phone, that bad boy is still powered up by the battery. You might not see anything on, but trust me, the mic and camera are still activated. It's like you're making a call and just leaving your phone on the kitchen table while you chat away with someone in the room. Scary stuff, man.

Now, I know some of y'all won't believe me, but this ain't no secret technology or anything. The military has some mind-blowing tech, for real. I've had a sneak peek at some of it, and let me tell ya, it's mind-boggling.

And hey, if you need proof, just look it up. There have been cases where they've used this stuff to gather evidence against the mafia, like some real high-profile sh*t. So yeah, it's legit. Do your research, my dude.
------
Okay, so I'm totally confused here. How the heck do we even know how old trees are just by counting some rings? Seriously, who came up with this crap? Like, did someone back in the day have nothing better to do than slice open a tree and start counting its damn rings? And don't get me started on the whole not killing the tree thing. Like, how the hell do you count these rings without actually chopping the damn thing down? Do they have some secret superpower that allows them to see through the bark or something?

And another thing, how old does a tree have to be before it starts sprouting these rings? Is it like puberty for trees or what? And you're saying that the rings represent each year of growth? So, the older the tree, the more freakin' circles it has? That's some crazy voodoo magic right there.

Honestly, this whole tree ring business sounds like a load of hocus pocus to me. Can someone please explain this in simple terms that my simple brain can understand? Appreciate it, y'all.
------
Yo, I gotta say, claiming support without even testing? That's some lazy-ass shit right there. Like, seriously, if you're gonna claim that X supports Z just because Y supports Z, then you better damn well back it up with some actual proof. And this whole "my HTML-only site works on all web browsers" nonsense? Come on, man. Ain't nobody got time to test every single browser out there, but at least have the decency to test a few major ones, not just assume that everything will magically work fine on all of them. Sure, standard HTML should work pretty well, but you can never be too sure. Bugs can creep up anywhere, my friend. So might wanna quit being lazy and actually do some proper testing before claiming support, yeah?
------
Wow, it's clear that you have some strong opinions! But let's try to keep the discussion respectful and open-minded. It's important to remember that not all Democrats support the things you mentioned. People have different reasons for voting for a particular party, and it's essential to listen to and understand their perspectives.

Regarding abortions, it's a complex and sensitive topic. The goal should be to minimize the need for abortions through comprehensive sex education, affordable contraception, and accessible healthcare. Legal and safe abortions provide an option for those facing difficult circumstances, but it doesn't mean everyone supports or encourages them.

When it comes to fiscal responsibility, both Democrats and Republicans have their strengths and weaknesses. It's unfair to generalize that one party is better than the other. Responsible governance requires finding a balanced approach to spending, taxation, and economic growth.

As for socialism, it's a broad term that can mean different things to different people. It's essential to have meaningful discussions about policies and ideas without resorting to exaggerated fears or stereotypes. Let's focus on understanding each other's perspectives and finding common ground instead of divisive language.
------
Nestle, seriously? You're really gonna play the cost and time card here? I mean, come on! You're a huge freakin' company with more brands than anyone can even keep track of, and you're whining about having to produce some freakin' reports? It's not like you're some struggling little mom and pop shop, scraping by to make ends meet. You've got enough money to buy half the world!

And now you're trying to play it off like it's some huge burden to prepare these reports for each country? Boo-freakin'-hoo! Maybe if you weren't so busy exploiting natural resources and taking advantage of vulnerable communities, you'd actually have time to do some legitimate work. But no, Nestle just wants to complain and avoid accountability like always.

I see right through you, Nestle. You've got something to hide, and you're just using this "cost and time" excuse as a smokescreen. Well, newsflash, buddy: we're onto you. And we're not buying your lame excuses anymore. Shape up or ship out!
------
sasuke may have some cool abilities, but let's be real here. Naruto is on a whole different level. Physical strength? Naruto could squash Sasuke like a bug. And don't even get me started on his nine-tails mode or whatever it's called. That thing is like a power boost on steroids. Sasuke's susanoo ain't gonna do jack against that kind of raw power.

Sure, Sasuke has his fancy amaterasu and teleporting rinnegan, but Naruto can just brush off that black flame nonsense. And the teleporting? Please. It's got limits, man. Naruto would just outlast him, no problem.

I don't care how skilled Sasuke thinks he is, he's just not on Naruto's level. The dude has the strength, the speed, and all those bijuu abilities in his back pocket. Sasuke can try to make up for it with his so-called variety, but it's just not enough. Naruto is the real deal, end of story.
------
Alright, let me break this down for you in the most straightforward way possible. Who the hell cares about levels of cooperation with evil in Catholicism? Like seriously, are we really gonna debate this crap on Reddit? Get a life, people!

But fine, if you wanna get into it, let's talk about this button-building dude. If he built those buttons specifically to release killer bears and watched people get mauled, then yeah, he's a sick bastard and directly responsible. But if he's just some innocent button maker who had no clue his buttons would be used for evil purposes, then why the hell should he be held accountable? Intent, knowledge, and control, my ass!

Oh, and don't even get me started on the mailperson delivering bomb-making materials. Look, they're just doing their damn job! They probably have no idea what's inside those packages, and let's be real, the materials are likely disguised anyway. So why should we blame the poor mailperson for doing their freakin' job?

Honestly, people need to stop overthinking and nitpicking every little thing. Life's too short to waste time discussing hypothetical scenarios on Reddit. Can't we all just move on and enjoy some dank memes instead?
------
Alright listen up, you bunch of whiners. If anyone dare lays a finger on you, here's what you gotta do. First off, don't come crying to me expecting sympathy, because I sure as hell won't give it. But hey, I'll pretend to listen to your pathetic tales of woe, alright? Maybe we can even brainstorm some half-assed solutions together, even if you were totally in the wrong when it all went down.

Now, don't get any ideas about vengeance, 'cause I ain't about that life. I'm not gonna go all Rambo and beat up the person who hurt you, or snitch on them to the po-po without talking it through first. 'Cause ya know, who needs justice, right?

And here's a real kicker for you delicate flowers - it doesn't matter if you choose to keep it a secret until you're ancient and wrinkly, I'll still entertain your sob story. Isn't that sweet? Just don't expect me to actually care.

Oh, and before you start blaming yourself or questioning whether you deserved it, let me make one thing crystal clear: if someone forced themselves upon you, it's always wrong, no matter how confused or messed up the situation is. So there you have it, folks. My guide to not giving a damn.
------
Man, let me tell you about this messed up situation I had at work. So, I just got this office job, right? And I'm the only dude in the whole department. Now, these ladies I work with are definitely not weaklings, but for some reason, they always look to me when there's heavy lifting to be done.

So, we have this rotating schedule for stocking the freakin' stockroom. And when it's my turn, guess what? I gotta do it all by myself! When I asked my boss why, she had the audacity to say it's because I'm "a big strong man." Can you believe that nonsense?

But here's where it gets even worse. One day, I had a ton of work to do and was falling behind. And what do my lazy coworkers do? They tell me to stop and fill the stockroom because I'm "big and strong." I had enough of their crap, so I straight up told them to quit being lazy and sexist. I mean, they're always going on about how strong and independent they are, so why can't they handle it themselves?

Well, let me tell ya, that little rant of mine got me in some hot water real quick. I got dragged into HR within an hour, and they wrote me up for sexual harassment and having sexist attitudes toward women. Can you believe the nerve? They demoted me back to the freakin' floor, put me on some crappy off shift, and to top it all off, gave me a pay cut.

I'm so fed up with all this BS, it's unreal. Anyone else been through something like this?
------
Alright, listen up folks. I don't know why y'all are wasting your time debating whether someone like Cosby is a good guy or a bad guy. Newsflash: there's no such thing! It's all subjective crap. So, stop giving a damn about what other people think of him. It's not like their opinion matters anyway. And guess what? It's not like Cosby can control how people remember him either. So, instead of getting all worked up about his legacy, focus on your own sorry excuse for a life. Yeah, that's right, think about how you'll be remembered. Spoiler alert: it's also out of your control, just like Cosby's legacy is to him. So, get off your high horse and move on already. Life's too short to waste it on pointless debates.
------
I gotta say, Path of Exile just doesn't do it for me. I mean, I get that some people love it, but for me, it's all about Grim Dawn. That game feels like a real adventure, you know? I love being able to customize my hero and dive into the quests. The world building and lore are top-notch too, if you're into that kinda stuff.

But let's talk about Diablo 3...ugh. That story is so hamfisted, it's like they're shoving it down your throat. And honestly, it's just boring. Sure, some aspects are cool, but overall, it just doesn't grab my attention.

And don't even get me started on the constant enemy spam in Diablo 3. Seriously, every zone feels like a freaking sardine can of enemies. I need a breather sometimes, you know?

Diablo 3 might be fun if you're looking for some mindless arcade action, but when it comes to a proper ARPG experience, it falls flat. I want to build a hero around specific weapons and skills, something that Path of Exile and Grim Dawn nail perfectly.
------
Alright, listen up folks. So apparently, God let Adam and Eve go wild with free will, knowing damn well they were gonna mess up. Like, seriously, couldn't he have made them immune to sin or something? But nooo, he had to let them be tempted. Even Jesus, the big man himself, was tempted by the devil. And you know what? He resisted! So why couldn't Adam and Eve do the same? It's not like God couldn't have tested their loyalty in some other way. But no, Eve just had to go and eat that forbidden fruit and screw everything up.

And don't even get me started on Adam. I mean, seriously bro? You loved your wife more than God? Way to prioritize, man. God literally told you not to eat that fruit, but you just listened to your wife instead. And Eve, don't even get me started on her selfishness. She made herself her own god, thinking she knew better than the big man upstairs. Talk about arrogance.

So yeah, when you think about it, their screw-up is kinda relatable. We all make mistakes for the people we care about or because we desire something we shouldn't have. Just like Adam and Eve. It's all messed up, but hey, that's life I guess. Hope that makes some sense to you guys. Peace out.
------
Look, I get what you're trying to say, but let's be real here. OP clearly didn't single out Christians in their post. It's obvious that when they said no one can be omniscient and omnipotent, they were talking about all the big religions out there. From Christianity to Islam and even Hinduism, it applies to all of 'em. And don't even get me started on the different denominations within Christianity alone. They all have their own views and interpretations, just like every other religion out there.

So yeah, when you say "baptists are wrong about Jesus claiming to be God," you're missing the whole point of what OP was saying. They weren't talking about specific beliefs within a religion, they had a broader scope in mind. And honestly, it's pretty clear who falls into that category. I mean, come on, it's right there in the post. Most people in that category are probably Christians, but that doesn't mean it's limited to Christianity. So let's not twist their words, alright?

Wow, it's hilarious how people still cling to ancient religious texts for moral guidance. Like seriously, wake up and smell the 21st century! The Bible and its outdated commandments are nothing more than relics from a bygone era. If you really think we should be following those "bronze age dictums," then I have to question your ability to think for yourself. Newsflash, buddy: humanity has evolved, and we now have this amazing thing called reason and logic. We don't need some ancient book to tell us right from wrong. So yeah, keep living in the dark ages if you want, but the rest of us rational thinkers will continue to move forward and leave that nonsense behind.

Wow, the left really needs to get their act together. It's no wonder people voted for Trump when all they do is throw around baseless insults like "racist, sexist, homophobe, nazi". Seriously, can they come up with anything new? And don't even get me started on this whole "own your white privilege" nonsense. The left is so obsessed with political correctness and policing everyone's language that they've completely lost touch with reality.

Instead of focusing on attacking Trump's personal life or body parts, maybe the left should try coming up with some legitimate criticisms. But no, it's all about "liar liar pants on fire" and making fat jokes about Trump's momma. Really? Is that the best they can do? It's no wonder Trump's "i'm rubber you're glue" defense is working so well. The left needs to step up their game if they want to have any chance of winning over the non-coastal citizens of the USA.

Dude, I gotta say, your comment is all over the place. I mean, seriously? You start off kinda sorta making a good point, but then you go and ruin it with that "she's pretty for a black girl" crap. Like, come on, man! Can you not see how messed up that sounds? It's like you're saying being black automatically makes someone less attractive. That's some racist nonsense right there.

And then you try to backpedal, talking about how if she were white, no one would mention her race. Yeah, no shit Sherlock! It's because being white isn't seen as some kind of stigma like being black apparently is to you. And don't even get me started on your whole "biologically attracted to one race" argument. That's just a load of BS.

Look, I get that you're conflicted and your head hurts or whatever, but maybe educate yourself before spewing ignorant comments. This is not a good look, my friend. Get your act together and think before you speak, alright? Peace out.
------
I don't get why people are making a big fuss about this whole school funding thing. Like, seriously, if a school doesn't have enough demand, it's just gonna fail, right? So who cares if there are some rural areas where there's not enough demand for a school? It's not like everyone needs to go to school anyway. And yeah, I guess it sucks that poorer school districts don't have enough funding, but why should we stop people from funding good schools just to make the worse schools a little better? That's just gonna make the money less productive, right? I mean, come on, let people invest their money where they want to. It's not like it's gonna solve all the problems, but it's better than nothing. So can we all just move on now?
------
Yo, I saw this crazy idea somewhere about making cosmetic items pay to win. I can't remember the company, but basically they want to match players based on how many cosmetics they buy. The more you spend, the easier opponents you get, and the less you spend, the tougher opponents you face. It's like they wanna make you think that buying fancy skins makes you a pro gamer or something.

I mean, seriously? Are they really that desperate for money that they gotta mess with matchmaking? It's gonna be so unfair for the players who don't spend a dime. Like, imagine getting wrecked by some dude with a shiny bling everywhere, just because they bought a bunch of stupid cosmetics. And if you're dumb enough to fall for it and actually spend money, you'll realize how much better you suddenly are.

This could totally be happening in a game like Fortnite already, you know? They're all about milking players for cash. But honestly, it's just a sleazy move and ruins the whole experience. Just let us enjoy the damn game without this greedy bullshit.
------
I can't even believe this crap. How can they not fund ambulances for everyone? It's not like emergencies only happen to people who can afford it. This membership system is such a load of bull. We should just have a new damn tax to cover it, end of story.

And seriously, why the hell would they refer someone to drug and alcohol counseling when she's already stressed out?! That's just adding more fuel to the fire. Are these people stupid or what?

Now they're gonna have an inquest about whether she got proper care during her pregnancy and if she should have been considered high risk. Uh, hello? She had chronic symptoms and she's aboriginal. That should've been a no-brainer! I swear, whoever is responsible for this neglect and harassment better face some serious jail time.

Sorry for the rant, but I am beyond pissed right now. Can't catch a break in this messed up world.
------
Man, I gotta say, those guys are freaking awesome. "Swimming Pool" has been my freaking summer anthem for ages now. I don't even know why, but that tune just puts me in the mood for reminiscing about all those sick hangouts with my buddies.

And let me tell you about this mind-blowing live performance I stumbled upon. It's like one of the best freaking gigs I've ever seen, man. It's a bit on the long side, but trust me, it's worth every minute. You can just have it playing in the background while you do your thing.

Oh, and get this, there's this hilarious moment where Brian stops the whole darn show just because some dude needed to tie his dang shoes. And he's all like, "Dude, seriously? Both shoes?" I swear, the whole gig is full of these awesome interactions. You gotta check it out, bro!
------
Wow, seriously? I can't believe what I'm reading here. Talk about being overly sensitive and hypocritical. So, this chick thinks it's perfectly fine to have irrational reasons for not playing a damn video game? And she's trying to justify it by bringing up her grandparents fleeing the Nazi regime? Give me a break! Just because her ancestors went through some stuff doesn't mean she gets a free pass to be a whiny little baby about playing a WWII game. And what's with the whole hammer and sickle thing? So, she's cool with glorifying one oppressive regime but not another? How does that even make sense?

Honestly, if I were the boyfriend, I'd dump her ass in a heartbeat. Who wants to be with someone who gets all icky and offended over a freaking video game? Grow up and get over yourself, lady. There are bigger problems in the world than your silly little hang-ups. If you can't handle playing a game that thousands of people enjoy without turning it into some political statement, then maybe you shouldn't be playing games at all. What a joke!
------
Yo, what's up with this sub? It's like déjà vu, man. People here are quick to label all Christians as money-hungry scumbags just because Kong Hee did some shady stuff. Now, it seems like they've switched gears and are bashing Catholics. Come on, guys! Every denomination has its good and bad apples. It ain't fair to lump all Protestants together as being anti-Catholic. And it's definitely not cool to call all Catholics pedos. That's just messed up. Sure, we can't ignore the bad actions of a few, but that doesn't mean everyone else is guilty by association. We need to be more nuanced in our discussions, people. Don't jump to conclusions based on the actions of a few. That's just straight up ignorance. Let's keep it real and reasonable here, y'all.
------
Damn, dude, I gotta say, your chat skills are on point! But you know what? You could totally take it up a notch and dive deeper into the topics. I mean, why the hell would she think that people who abuse their power wouldn't already be into taekwondo? Instead of completely changing the subject, it's way better to kinda branch off from it and keep the conversation going smoothly. And bro, seriously, stop with the multiple shallow questions. It just makes you seem all over the place and like you're desperately trying to find something she's interested in. The most important person to please and keep interested is yourself, man. So own what you like and think it's cool. After all, self-expression is the goddamn master of coolness.

Hey guys, I've been checking out the Sony APS-C stuff lately and I gotta say, the ergonomics are a major turn off for me. I mean, have you tried holding those things? Not to mention the autofocus was pretty crappy until the a6500 came along. And don't even get me started on the battery life, it's like they didn't even bother considering it. Oh, and the overheating issues? Yeah, that was a thing.

On the other hand, low light performance with Fuji's is something I still think about. I'm used to full frame cameras like the a7iii and the D750 where low light was never an issue. But hey, the Fujis can still do the job, especially with that new XT3 promising better noise performance with its BSI sensor.

I have to admit, the XT3 does look pretty solid for video too. If you're into hybrid shooting, it's definitely worth considering, even if it means stretching your budget a bit.

Now, let's talk about Fuji's ergonomic. They're not bad, I'll give them that. But personally, I prefer the good old DSLR method of changing settings with physical dials. I guess I'm just used to it, you know? But hey, as time goes by, the Fuji way bothers me less and less. It's not really an advantage for me, just a different way of doing things.
------
Yo, what's up fellow Redditors? Just stumbled upon this subreddit and damn, y'all be overcomplicating things like crazy! I mean, seriously, three heads of the dragon? Dany, Jon, Aegon... who the hell knows anymore? And then you guys go off on a wild goose chase, trying to connect every single dot and make it all about fAegon or Targ Tyrion. Like, come on, Occam's Razor anyone?

For those who don't know, Occam's Razor is basically saying that when faced with multiple explanations, the simplest one is usually the right one. But nope, not in this sub. We got people coming up with crazy explanations like meteorites colliding and evaporating just to explain a windfall in a damn field. I mean, c'mon!

So, what other theories or opinions have you found here that just make you go "What the f***?" Let's have a laugh and see if we can find some common sense in this sub. Anyone else agree with me?
------
Dude, I totally get where you're coming from. I was just as freaked out about kissing my girlfriend when we first started dating. It's like our brains just go into overdrive and start imagining all these crazy scenarios. But here's the thing, you gotta stop overthinking it and just go for it.

Next time you're with him, just ask if he wants to kiss. It's that simple. Trust me, he probably wants to but is too scared to make the move. And don't worry about texting too much either. I used to do the same thing and it's a waste of time. Just text him whenever you want to and if he's bothered, he'll let you know.

The key is to stop second-guessing yourself and just go with the flow. You got this, man. Don't be stupid like me and overthink everything. Just go in for the kiss and see where it takes you. Good luck!
------
Look, I completely agree with you on this one. Lobbyists, MLMs, and televangelists are all in the business of taking people's hard-earned cash and giving them nothing in return. Lobbyists may not directly ask the public for funds, but they're still making money off of their shady deals and connections. And MLMs? Don't even get me started. They lure you in with empty promises of financial freedom and being your own boss, but all they really want is your money and your soul-sucking labor.

But let's talk about televangelists, shall we? These snake oil salesmen take manipulation to a whole new level. They exploit people's faith and desperation, convincing them that if they just give more money, pray harder, and sacrifice everything, God will bless them.

It's sickening how they prey on the vulnerable, convincing them to forgo medical treatments, mortgage their homes, and push themselves to the brink of poverty all in the name of faith. And what do they do with all that money? Buy fancy cars, private jets, and live a life of luxury while their followers suffer.

Honestly, it's infuriating. These televangelists are nothing more than heartless con artists, profiting off the misery and desperation of others. It's a shame that they exist and continue to get away with it.

Hey guys, 

So I'm trying to figure out this whole multiple entries thing for the Thai embassy in LA. Like seriously, why can't they just spell it out for us? I mean, yeah, I get it, you have to leave every 60 days, but does that mean in and out multiple times? Can someone please clarify this for me? And if you've actually done this recently, I would really appreciate hearing from you. I mean, who needs official information when we can just rely on word of mouth, right? 

By the way, gotta give a shoutout to the Washington website, man. They actually know how to provide clear info and stuff. Now I have to play detective and find out if LA and DC have different damn requirements. Ugh, this is frustrating. 

Anyways, any help or insider knowledge would be greatly appreciated! Thanks, y'all!
------
Dude, seriously? Are you even reading what you're typing? Your comment is just pure nonsense and it's making my brain hurt. No one asked for your self-proclaimed superiority or your hypocritical opinions. Who cares if someone has nostalgia over toxic gamers? It's their own damn choice and it doesn't affect you in any way. And calling someone cringy just because they have a different opinion than you? That's just low. Maybe you should take a step back and think about how your pointless comment adds absolutely nothing to the conversation. But hey, I guess some people just need to feel important by putting others down. Grow up, man.
------
Alright, listen up people. I gotta get something off my chest. So, I used to be a filthy pirate back in the day. Couldn't afford to buy albums every week, you know how it is. But hey, times have changed and now I'm a legit Spotify user. Yeah, I actually cough up my hard-earned cash for that shit. Now here's the thing, I get it. I totally do. I understand why people pirate stuff, but let's be real here. If you're gonna steal, at least make it count! You know what I'm saying? Take that money you saved and use it for something useful. Go to a damn concert, buy a freakin' t-shirt. Support the artists, man! And don't even get me started on those computer programs and games. If you're gonna pirate that shit, at least throw some moolah towards the company, especially those indie game developers. Cut out the middleman and do it the right way, goddammit!
------
Honestly, I'd just tell those losers to back the hell off. You don't need their lame-ass invitations if you don't want to go. Who needs friends like that anyway? 

I've been in your shoes, and let me tell you, it sucks. But here's what I did: I stopped wasting my energy on those one-sided friendships and focused on building new relationships. Keep an eye on how people treat you, not gonna lie, it's like keeping score. Find people who actually give a damn about you and put effort into those connections.

Also, maybe you've become the damn event planner for your so-called friends. They're probably just lazy jerks who rely on you to do all the work. Start saying no to them, and watch how they suddenly notice your absence. They'll come crawling back to you, begging for your attention.

So screw those idiots and find real friends who appreciate you for who you are. You deserve better, dude.
------
Wow, this whole Hitler and the church thing is messed up. I mean, I'm not surprised that the church was all buddy-buddy with Hitler. They were probably thinking, "Hey, if we cozy up to this guy, maybe we can gain some power or something." And it's not like they suddenly grew a conscience when they realized they might be next on the chopping block. No, they were just looking out for themselves, as always.

I found some articles that shed some light on this crap. Vanity Fair has an article called "Hitler's Pope" that gives you all the juicy details. Then there's an independent article that sums up the history of the church and Hitler, with a special focus on Ratzinger's Hitler Youth past. Seriously, how messed up is that?

If you're up for some heavier reading, there's a Guenter Lewy paperback that goes into even more detail. And hey, if you're into bite-sized info, BBC has some bits on it, although I couldn't find their sources. But Facing History has an abstract on the subject, and they might have sources listed somewhere. They seem pretty legit.

I also found a short excerpt with some more reading suggestions if you're super into this messed up stuff. But really, it's pretty clear that for the church, morality comes second to preserving their damn power. Ugh.
------
I mean, honestly, I gotta say that this seed catalog company really needs to step up their game. Like, seriously, they just throw out seeds in their packets that aren't even reliable. Come on, guys, get it together! I've tried a few of their varieties and let me tell you, it's hit or miss. And let's be real, it's more miss than hit. I've had way better luck with other seed companies, no shade. But I will give them credit for at least trying to bring some rare varieties into the mix. That's kinda cool, I guess. But they seriously need to work on their quality control, like ASAP. I mean, I don't want to waste my time and money on seeds that may or may not grow. Get your act together, seed catalog company!
------
Wait, hold up! Are you seriously saying that having plastic cages or not having plastic cages is the only thing that matters? Come on, man, there are so many other factors to consider here. Plus, who cares if there's a bit of plastic in water bottles or food? We've been ingesting that stuff for years and we're still alive, aren't we?

And injections in the brain? Seriously, dude? Do you even know what you're talking about? There are other ways to administer stuff into the body, you know. Like, through the veins, duh!

And this whole argument about high-impact publications and being "set for life"? Give me a break! Just because someone shows some correlation doesn't mean they've discovered the holy grail of science. They need to show some solid proof and not just make wild claims.

And why the heck are you so obsessed with questioning this researcher's integrity? Did you find some juicy gossip or what? Quit acting all Sherlock Holmes and focus on the actual science, dude. Geez!
------
Okay, let's break it down.

Point #1: RISC vs CISC. RISC does simpler instructions faster, while CISC encapsulates complex instructions. So, it's basically a tradeoff. RISC is good for simple stuff, but you gotta build complex things out of simple ones. CISC is slower, but you get those complex instructions in one shot.

Point #2: ARMv8. It may be called "reduced," but it ain't small. It's got a bunch of multiplication instructions, different types, and extra arithmetic. Shifting, rotating, bitfields, memory access, prefetching, floating point, cryptography, exception handling, debugging, hints – this thing's got it all!

Point #3: Now here's the kicker. If CISC is so dang fast, why are iPhone chips running on a puny battery beating some of Intel's laptop chips? Those fan-less iPhones are setting the benchmark ablaze!

So yeah, that's my take. RISC vs CISC, ARMv8 flexin' and iPhone chips kickin' butt. What do y'all think?
------
Yo, fellow Redditors! Just gotta vent for a sec. So, like, I've been seeing all this talk about straight bioqueens lately, and honestly, it ain't even a new thing. They've been around, man! As drag gets more mainstream, it's only natural that we'll see more of 'em.

And let me tell ya, drag isn't some safe space. It's an artform meant to be shared and appreciated by everyone, regardless of their orientation. As long as people don't forget about its history and legacy, we'll be cool.

Oh, and can we talk about Drag Race? Seriously, that show doesn't even represent all the facets of drag. They always focus on those Paris references, but we had one ball queen, like, seven years ago. It's time they give more love to classic queens like Kasha and Darienne. And where are the pure dancing queens or pageant queens among the winners?

But you know what really grinds my gears? Some of these gay audience members, man. They bully and harass queens just for sticking to the drag queen expectations. Like, come on! Restricting drag to gays only is just plain dumb. Not all gay peeps appreciate or respect drag automatically.

Alright, rant over. Keep slaying, drag fam! Peace out.
------
Yo, seriously? You just gonna ignore my first freakin' point? I'm talkin' about Kaepernick gettin' advice from a green beret and you act like it don't even matter. Like, come on man, that's straight up dumb. I made it pretty damn clear in my last post.

And yo, I ain't talkin' 'bout service members, I'm talkin' 'bout all them NFL fans and so-called "patriots" who lose their minds over players takin' a knee. Read my words carefully, bro. It's the fans and the fake patriots hidin' behind the flag that I'm callin' out here.

You say I can do as I please? Well, guess what? I never once thought I needed your frickin' approval. So keep that in mind next time.

Look, let me break it down for you. Communities of color are tryna say that if they just kneel peacefully, they still get treated like crap. Like, if they fit some damn description, they could end up gettin' shot before anyone even tries to figure out the truth. That's why Kaepernick did what he did, man. He put his career on the line to make a point on a big stage.
------
Yo, listen up y'all! I gotta share something with you that changed my whole damn life! My man Jesus, he's like the ultimate fire insurance policy. Seriously, this dude saved me from burning in hell for all eternity. Can you even comprehend the magnitude of that? And not only that, but he gave me eternal life, baby! Like, I'm gonna live forever, thanks to him!

I mean, let's think about it. I totally deserved to be roasting in the fiery pits of hell, but instead, this guy comes along and offers me living water. Living freakin' water, people! It's like having a never-ending supply of refreshment. No more thirst, no more feeling empty inside. This water is legit flowing up inside me, giving me everlasting life. Talk about a game-changer!

And check out what John 4:10, 14 says, Jesus himself said it. If you knew the gift of God and who he is, you'd be all over this living water stuff. So, don't sleep on it, folks. Embrace Jesus, get your fire insurance, and enjoy that everlasting life. Trust me, it's the best decision you'll ever make!
------
Yo, I just gotta vent about my time working at ttg. Man, it was a straight-up mess. I was with them for a year, and let me tell you, the devs were getting paid peanuts. No joke, they were seriously underpaid. And to top it off, the higher-ups treated the community like crap! Seriously, they couldn't care less about the fans who were hella dedicated and loyal.

But wait, it gets worse. When I was there, they had this so-called "super secret" project with the iPad. Like, seriously, they sent company-wide emails telling us not to even look at or talk to the devs working on it. They straight-up isolated those poor guys in a conference room for over 9 freaking months. Can you believe that?

Honestly, I'm just glad I left that place. It was a total dumpster fire. But hey, at least I got some credits on some cool games. Peace out!
------
Yo, listen up everyone. I'm just your average Redditor, no fancy schmancy alts or anything. But seriously, what's up with all this drama about AMAs? Like, seriously, they're everywhere! IAMA doesn't own the rights to AMA, so why the fuss?

You come here, all outraged, acting like you got some hardcore evidence to back up your claims. But honestly, I ain't seeing it. And guess what? Nobody else seems to be on your side either. You've been whining and griping for ages, but have you convinced a single soul? Nope.

So, do us all a favor and take your complaint elsewhere. We're tired of hearing it, and frankly, you're just wasting everyone's precious time. End of story.
------
Look, I get it, we all have our frustrations, but seriously? Saying that all women have the personality of a piece of cardboard? That's just plain disrespectful and ignorant. Have you ever stopped to think that maybe the problem lies with you and your crappy attitude?

And let's not even start with your friend who's short and Filipino. What does that have to do with anything? Are you implying that only tall white guys can have success in relationships? Give me a break.

Instead of spewing this toxic nonsense, why don't you actually try to offer some helpful advice to this guy? Maybe suggest that he works on himself, improves his confidence, and learns how to communicate effectively. Blaming all his problems on women is not going to solve anything.

And yeah, therapy might not be the first step, but it's definitely something to consider if he's feeling unhappy. So quit being a judgmental prick and try showing a little empathy for once.
------
So, get this guys. About a month ago, I had this major fuck up that I can finally laugh about now. So here's the deal - my husband works crazy night shifts at the hospital, and his schedule is all over the place. He does all the house chores and errands, even when he's not working. Now, I come from this small town in Wyoming where we don't even lock our doors, so living in the city is a whole new ball game for me.

Anyway, we're selling my car since we only have one parking spot and I have a motorcycle. So, I'm in line for the car wash with my dog in the back seat, and I spot this thing that looks like a squirt gun. I'm thinking, "Oh, cute! It must be a spice grinder for camping!" So, I grab it and decide to try it out. I aim it at my hand and press the trigger, expecting some salt and pepper action.

Well, turns out it's not a spice grinder. Nope, it's freaking pepper spray in the form of a gun! Instantly, a spring goes off and I'm covered in red. I'm freaking out, thinking I shot myself or something. And on top of that, I'm trapped in the car wash line with no way to escape. My face is burning, my dog is sneezing, and I'm just a hot mess.

Long story short, I had my face in a bowl of milk for hours and had to spend $200 to get the car detailed. It's still not completely back to normal, but at least it's better. I might try some special painting technique on the sun visor to fix it up. Oh, and of course, I'm still blaming my husband for leaving the damn pepper spray in the car.

Lesson learned: never trust a random "spice gun" you find in your car. Trust me, I'm an idiot.

TL;DR - Husband left pepper spray gun in the car, and I pepper sprayed myself, making it a nightmare to sell my pristine car. The struggle is real, my friends.

Yo, I gotta say, this chick totally freaked out for no reason. Like seriously, we were just giving some honest feedback in this college class, and she goes all dramatic and deletes everything? Talk about overreacting. She probably thought she was gonna get fired or something, but like, honestly, if she had just asked for help with the slides, we could've sorted it out, no biggie. I mean, it's a graphic design college, someone could've whipped up a PowerPoint or PDF in a weekend. But nah, she panicked and thought we'd be scared, and when we didn't back down, she got all powerless and wanted to have the last word.

But hey, I learned a couple of things from this mess. First, even if you didn't do anything wrong, you can still suffer consequences when it's easier to blame a whole group. Second, when people ask for feedback, they usually only want to hear the good stuff and can't handle anything negative. Lesson learned, I guess.
------
Umm, actually, I think you got it all wrong. It's not about sunlight, buddy, it's definitely about temperature. Like, duh! When it gets cold, those trees start losing their leaves. It's like they're saying "oh no, it's getting chilly, time to shed these useless leaves." And it's not just about polar trees, it happens everywhere. Even the ones near the equator, when winter comes, they're like "peace out, leaves!" So yeah, temperature plays a big role in this leaf-dropping game. Maybe do some research before spreading your theories, alright? Don't get me wrong, I appreciate your attempt at scientific explanation, but stick to the facts next time, dude. Peace! 😎🍂

Sorry, but I can't generate that story for you.

Yo, let me tell you about the time I had to deal with some nasty cockroaches when I was in New Orleans. I swear, those little suckers were straight out of a horror movie. So there I was, chillin' on my porch one night, minding my own business when I spotted one of those creepy crawlies next to me on the step. Without thinking twice, I grabbed the nearest can of bug spray and gave that sucker a good hit. But guess what? That little devil didn't die or run away like I expected. Instead, it ran into the frickin' leaves and, out of nowhere, a whole flipping army of roaches came after it! It was like a freaking stampede, man. I could hear their tiny legs scurrying through the leaves and it scarred the living hell outta me. That experience made me swear off bug spray for life, and you can bet your ass I'm never living in New Orleans again. Those roaches can have that city all to themselves!

Man, remember those futuristic digital effects they used to have in live shows back in the day? At the time, they were mind-blowing and cutting-edge. But now, if I see that stuff, I can't help but think it's silly and outdated. It's like they tried too hard to be cool and futuristic, and now it just feels like a cheesy gimmick.

I mean, sure, it was impressive when no one else was doing it. But now every small-time indie fed can use those same effects if they want to. It's no longer special or unique. Sometimes, less is more, you know? Maybe if they want to give it another shot, they should tone it down and be more subtle about it. Otherwise, it's just gonna come off as another goofy attempt to be flashy.
------
Alright, I gotta say this shit is just straight-up bizarre. Like seriously, what the actual fuck is going on here? Are they trying to pass off this dancing shit as some kind of legit practice? Give me a break. It's so obvious that they're messing with her and it's painfully cringey to watch. I mean, come on, why the hell would they be prancing around in a damn dance circle like a bunch of goddamn clowns? That's not how the military operates, people! This whole thing reeks of bullshit and it's insulting to think they expect us to buy into their little charade. Can someone please explain to me what the actual purpose of this nonsense is, because I'm at a loss here. It's just another example of the dumb shit you find on this subreddit.

Hey y'all! Just wanted to give you a heads up about this LC makeup situation. So, apparently, some stores are carrying the Venus 3 palette and a few matte velvetine lips in shades like red velvet, marshmallow, riot, and this cool metallic one called blondie. If you're curious where to find it, just search for ulta and then look for the locations that have it. 

But here's the deal: if you want more LC products in ulta, you gotta vote with your money! Like seriously, buy from them and show ulta that we want more. Rumor has it that if this test size sells well, they'll give LC a bigger display area. So, let's support it if we want it and if not, then don't buy it and tell others to do the same.

Oh, and by the way, if you care, Doe Deere, the brand's CEO, is outta there. She won't be involved in managing the company anymore. So, take that into consideration if it matters to ya. Peace out!

Wow, seriously? Are you actually considering putting this guy's name on the account? Are you out of your mind? I mean, come on, how naive can you be? You think you know him so well, huh? Well, newsflash, people change and surprise you all the time.

Did you have any clue that he would turn into a lazy stoner who can't be bothered to contribute a damn thing to your family? Or were you just living in La La Land, thinking "he wouldn't do that"? Wake up, lady! This decision shouldn't come from blind trust, it should come from common sense and protecting your daughter's future.

I bet you're just trying to avoid confrontation, even if it means risking your own daughter's education. What happens when this loser blows it all away and your poor kid has to beg her grandparents to pay for college? Is that what you want?

Sure, he's not likely to spend it on purpose, but he'll probably just be too damn irresponsible to pay it back or assume his mommy and daddy will save the day. Come on, grow a backbone and put your daughter first for once!

Look, I get it. Bill Gates may have some fancy tech in his house that changes with every damn guest, but let's not confuse wealth with taste. Yeah, those fashion institutions are famous, but it ain't because of show-offs buying their stuff from music videos. It's because they actually make quality products. Take Louis Vuitton, for example. Their bags will outlast your sorry ass for a hundred freakin' years because they use top-notch leather, hardware, and processes. They're playing the brand game, sure, but it helps them rake in a whopping 300 billion dollars in sales each year.

And don't even get me started on the fit. You won't know how damn good it is until you slip your sorry self into a Valentino jacket that was made just for you by some badass artisans using techniques that have been perfected over centuries.

So go ahead and bitch all you want about people needing validation from sporting logos, but don't you dare come after the quality and comfort of high-end clothing. It's on another level, my friend.
------
Wow, what a bunch of crybabies. Can't believe people are still complaining about getting banned from social media platforms for spewing out hate speech and being total assholes. Like seriously, who raised these idiots? Maybe if they spent half the time they spend whining about getting kicked off the internet actually trying to be decent human beings, they wouldn't have this problem.

And don't even get me started on those idiots who think they can just say whatever they want because "freedom of speech" or some crap like that. Newsflash, morons, freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences. If you're spreading hate and causing harm, no one wants to hear your garbage.

So, to all those snowflakes crying about censorship, tough luck! The internet is not your safe space to spread your toxic nonsense. These companies have the right to set their own rules and decide what kind of content they want on their platforms. If you don't like it, take your bigotry somewhere else. Good riddance!
------
Wow, can you believe the amount of bullshit that is fed to us in the military? I mean, seriously, this co guy thinks he can just lie to us like it's no big deal. First, he tells us one thing about our departure date and then changes it the next day. And let's not even get started on the whole "we'll be the first to know" crap. Yeah, right.

But what really grinds my gears is how the pilots get special treatment. They get to leave early, have a vacation in Spain, and then come back all fresh and relaxed while the rest of us have to wait around. I guess it's just another classic case of officers looking out for their own interests while screwing over the enlisted folks.

I swear, sometimes I wonder why I even bother serving this country when we're treated like pawns in some messed up game. It's frustrating as hell, but what can you do? Just gotta keep pushing through and hope that things get better.
------
Okay, seriously people, let's get real here. I don't give a damn if you have a fancy piece of paper saying you're some big-shot engineer. The truth is, most of you don't know squat about what you're actually talking about. You think you can just spew out some design and expect it to work flawlessly? Newsflash, genius, it doesn't work like that.

In the real world, you need more than just some theoretical knowledge to get shit done. You need practical skills, like being able to communicate effectively, manage projects, and overcome obstacles. And guess what? Those are the things that actually matter in most fields of engineering. It's not about coming up with some groundbreaking design that will revolutionize the world. It's about being able to navigate the messy reality of getting things built and making sure they don't collapse like a house of cards.

So, next time you want to dictate how an entire field should be run, maybe take a step back and realize that there's a lot more to it than just your fancy degree. Because when it comes down to it, if you're installing a damn sidewalk, I couldn't care less if you have a PhD.
------
Yo, what's up with California and all these pending laws? I mean, seriously, it's like they're trying to strip away our rights little by little. First, we got this sb1100 that's trying to stop adults under 21 from buying firearms. Are you kidding me? So now they're saying that just because you're not 21 yet, you can't exercise your Second Amendment right? Give me a break.

And then we got this ab2103 that's messing with the concealed carry permit requirements. Yeah, I get it, safety is important, but why make it even harder for law-abiding citizens to protect themselves? Now they want to make sure we have at least 8 hours of training, including live fire training. Like, who has time for that?

Oh, and don't even get me started on this sb1177. They wanna limit us to transferring only one firearm every 30 days. Are they afraid we're gonna start an armory or something? I don't know about you, but I like having options and being able to buy and sell firearms when I want.

And as if that wasn't enough, we got this ab2888 allowing people to report others to the authorities. Are we living in a police state or what? I mean, sure, if someone's a danger, report them, but this seems like a slippery slope to me.

And finally, they wanna ban gun shows at the cow palace? Are you serious? What's wrong with a little gun show fun? But hey, let's not forget to register to vote and make our voices heard. We gotta fight against these crazy laws, man. Don't let them take away our rights without a fight!
------
Man, I totally disagree with you on this whole Chinese growth thing. Like, seriously? You're saying it's all about Western capital and joint ventures with Chinese banks? Give me a break! China's got way more going on than that. Sure, maybe some Western capital played a role in financing those factories, but it's not the be-all and end-all.

And don't even get me started on this currency floating nonsense. Yeah, if they abandon Western capital and start subsidizing Chinese banks, they might have to float their currency to pay back their debts. But guess what? They can handle it. They're not stupid, you know. They've got a plan.

You're acting like tariffs are gonna be this big disaster for China. Yeah, maybe there'll be some short-term pain, but they'll figure it out. And as for the whole underwriting risk and bailing out banks thing, come on! China's government has deep pockets, my friend. They'll do whatever it takes to keep things afloat.

So quit with all this doom and gloom, alright? China's not gonna crumble overnight just because some Western capital disappears. They've got their own game going on, and they're not gonna let a little hiccup derail them.
------
Wow, chill out dude. You're going on and on about genes and judging people for reproducing like it's the end of the world. Who cares if someone wants to be a single parent? It's their damn choice, not yours. And what's with all this talk about "detective" genes? Are you some kind of genetic expert now? Give me a break. People have all kinds of health issues in their families, it doesn't make them any less worthy of having kids. And seriously, comparing mental illness to cancer? That's just messed up. They're completely different things, so stop trying to play the victim here. Nobody said your genes were perfect, so quit whining and get over yourself. Just let people live their lives and mind your own business.
------
Alright, listen up you ignorant folks! Let's talk about open access publications in reputable journals. Yes, I know it costs money, but get this through your thick skulls: no matter how amazing your study is, you gotta pay up. Don't even bother disagreeing with this fact, because it's the truth.

Take a look at these links I found for you. It clearly states that if you're a corresponding author from an institution with a site license, you'll get a discount on the open access fee. But guess what? Even with the discount, it's still gonna cost you a hefty sum. Nature Communications? Yeah, that'll set you back a whopping 5200 bucks. Scientific Data? It's a steal at only 1675. And don't even get me started on Scientific Reports, which will drain your wallet by a cool 1760.

Oh, and here's another reality check for you. Open access is becoming the norm because funding agencies are starting to demand it. Yup, they want your articles to be immediately free online. So if you're dreaming of getting published without shelling out some cash, wake up and smell the coffee.

Now, do I have any fellow redditors who want to share their thoughts or are we all on the same page here?
------
Yeah, I get it. Sometimes I'm impatient too, but who the hell are we to demand anything from this guy? He wrote those damn books because he felt like it, and luckily for us, we freaking loved them. If you're looking for more stuff to keep you occupied, check out his Dreamsongs and Wild Cards series. I've been diving into all his works lately, even watched that Beauty and the Beast adaptation. Can't say I'm into Hunter's Run though, just ain't my thing. And you know what? You can always hit up the library if you don't wanna fork over the cash for his stuff. But what pisses me off is how he keeps struggling to get shit done, then gets all depressed about it. And when the fans get annoyed, he gets even more down. It's messed up. Seriously, with all those Wild Card peeps on his team, why the hell doesn't he just ask them for help? They've been working together for like 30 years, they know his style and all that. If I were him, I'd have those guys tag team some of his projects. Maybe he has already asked and they said no, but I doubt it.
------
Damn, calm down there. You're getting all worked up over some canon shit. Who even cares if it's shorter? Maybe they just wanted to keep things concise and to the point. And yeah, who does get to interpret what's written? Like seriously, who made these rules? Just because some people have fancy degrees doesn't mean they have all the answers. And speaking of recognition, why don't we throw in every random text out there? Let's include Gthomas and Thunder the Perfect Mind too, why the hell not? We'll just make it a big ol' mess of a canon. And hey, you're right, this whole idea of some magical canon existing regardless of recognition is pretty damn silly. So let's just say screw it and nobody has the right to discern anything. It's chaos, baby.
------
Are you seriously suggesting that the defense funding of countries like the UK and Germany comes from the US? You must be out of your mind. It's not entirely true, my friend. What I'm saying is that the Americans do contribute a portion of the defense costs of many European nations. They're giving out military aid payments, deploying troops, and supporting NATO. Yeah, NATO does have a budget, and guess what? The US is paying almost a quarter of it. So don't come at me with this idea that Europe isn't chipping in. And that 2% spending guideline? It's a joke. Most European countries can't even meet that pathetic goal. Meanwhile, Greece and Poland are getting it done. It's about time these freeloading Europeans start standing on their own two feet and stop relying on the US. If they think they don't need NATO, then let them fund their own defense. We'll see how they cope when shit hits the fan. Udachi, vam eto ponadobitsia, tovarishch!
------
Man, I can't believe the delusional AEK fans on here. It's so obvious that there were no actual markings inside the box. Come on! If that's a penalty, then literally every little contact inside the box should be a penalty. And don't even get me started on corners in football, because apparently those would all result in penalties too. 

And hey, nice try picking a picture to prove me wrong about PAOK's penalty. But guess what? You conveniently forgot to show the contact the goalie had with Prijovic's foot. That was a clear dive too, just like the one from Mantalos. But hey, at least Mantalos's dive was pure comedy gold, right? Just like the good old days of Olympiakos. 

So yeah, keep living in your fantasy world AEK fans. It's entertaining to watch you guys twist reality to fit your narrative.
------
Ugh, seriously? People actually waste their time trying to make these crappy 3D-printed guns? Like, who the hell would trust their life with some janky-ass plastic piece of junk that could blow up in your face after a couple of shots? I mean, sure, maybe it's a cool little project to mess around with, but let's be real, these things are a joke when it comes to actual practical use.

And don't even get me started on the accuracy and power of these things. You're better off throwing rocks at your target, mate. These flimsy plastic contraptions can't handle the pressure or withstand any real force. So good luck hitting anything more than a few feet away.

Honestly, if you're so desperate for a gun, just go buy a real one like a normal person. Don't waste your time and risk your safety with these laughable 3D-printed disasters.

Hey everyone, just wanted to pop in and say that Peter F. Hamilton is an absolute legend when it comes to writing epic sci-fi novels. If you haven't read any of his works, you're seriously missing out on some mind-blowing storytelling. I mean, come on, the dude has written so many frickin' books, it's insane!

I personally recommend starting with the Night's Dawn Trilogy because it's like a rollercoaster ride of awesomeness. The Reality Dysfunction will blow your freakin' mind, trust me. And if you're into space opera stuff, the Commonwealth Saga is where it's at. Pandora's Star and Judas Unchained will have you hooked from start to finish.

But seriously, guys, no offense, but did we really need Peter F. Hamilton himself to come here and tell us about his books? I mean, we've got Google for that, right? Anyway, props to him for being here and all, but let's get back to discussing the real stuff - like which character we'd want as our drinking buddy in his novels. Cheers!
------
Yo, I just stumbled upon this post and damn, this dude has some serious entitlement issues. He's bitching about a subreddit that's all about being childfree not being all rainbows and unicorns when it comes to kids? Seriously? It's like he's expecting them to change their whole vibe just to suit his delicate sensibilities.

And let's not forget the creepy old man factor here. This guy only dates women who are decades younger than him? That's not some cool alternative relationship model, it's straight up predatory behavior. He's preying on younger, less experienced women who might fall for his manipulative bullshit. Real mature, dude.

But you know what? The fact that he's got a kid with one of these poor girls is exactly why there's a need for this space to vent about breeders and their shitty decisions. Frankly, I couldn't give a single fuck about what he thinks about it. He can take his complaints and shove 'em where the sun don't shine. We're here to support each other, not cater to entitled crybabies like him.
------
Are you seriously claiming that the Trump administration actually supports removing marijuana as a schedule 1 drug? Give me a break! Have you ever heard of Jeff Sessions? He's Trump's attorney general, and he's been one of the biggest opponents of weed. This guy has actually compared marijuana to freaking heroin! So don't come here telling us that Republicans and Trump give a damn about marijuana legalization. Just take a look at which states have legal weed - hint, they aren't exactly known for being conservative. It's ridiculous how they continue to keep it illegal and waste millions on their failed war on drugs. You're clearly misinformed, buddy.
------
Yo, listen up peeps! So there's this whole crazy drama going on with Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford. And let me tell ya, the only dude that could shed some light on this mess is Mark Judge.

Now, if I was a cop or something, I'd be like "yo, let's question this dude". You know, he's the common denominator here, so he might have some important info.

Look, I get it, legally they can't prosecute Kavanaugh. But come on, we're talking about a lifetime seat in the highest court! The Senate and the President owe it to us, the people, to dig deep and gather all the facts, testimonies, and any juicy info to decide if this dude is fit for the job.

They ain't investigating to find guilt, but to get the damn truth! Both Kavanaugh and Ford deserve their fair shots. I don't care if you're a Dem or a Repub, we all deserve the truth before someone sits their ass on that Supreme Court throne. Let's get to the bottom of this, people!
------
Are you freaking kidding me? Shizune? That weakling who got taken out by Kabuto back in the day? And then had the nerve to say Sakura was better than her because she couldn't use some fancy jutsu? Give me a break!

Tsunade knows more jutsus? Oh please, just because she has one little ability that she barely even used, doesn't mean Sakura can't handle it. She's the top medical ninja now, for crying out loud! She should have no problem dealing with that kind of stuff.

I'm not saying Sakura is some all-powerful goddess, but seriously, let's be real here. She basically has the same powers as Tsunade, and even Hashirama himself said her strength was greater. Plus, she's not wasting her chakra trying to look younger like Tsunade did. And that was when she was just a teenager! Imagine how badass she is now as an adult.
------
Dude, I totally get what you're saying. I had a similar experience before and it scared the crap out of me. One time, I stood up too fast and next thing I knew, I was on the damn floor like a sack of potatoes. It was like my brain just decided to take a mini vacation or something. Luckily, I didn't bonk my head on anything, so no pain there. But I swear, that whole moment just vanished from my memory. It's like my brain hit the "delete" button on that part of my life.

And you're right about the MMA stuff. Chokeouts are way different from knockouts. When you get choked, it's like a quick nap and you're back to normal in a few seconds. But when you get knocked out, man, you're all messed up. You stumble around like a drunk idiot and can't think straight for a while. It's like your brain got hit with a wrecking ball or something.

Anyway, it's freaky how our brains work, right? Has anyone else experienced this blackout memory thing? Let's swap stories!
------
Honestly, who the hell cares about Greek school? I mean, seriously, why waste your time trying to learn some old language that no one even uses anymore? Plus, if you're half-Greek and can't even speak the language, you're basically a joke to all the other cool Greek kids. But hey, at least you can dance, right? Who needs language skills when you've got sick dance moves? I'm sure all the Greek people in your community are super impressed by your sick dancing. So yeah, keep shaking your booty and forget about trying to actually connect with your culture. It's not like speaking Greek would actually make a difference or anything. Just keep being the nerdy kid who can't speak his own language but can bust a move. You're really making us all proud.
------
Yeah, I don't buy that whole "average house price" argument. Have you seen the crazy prices in places like Los Angeles or New York? Good luck finding anything remotely affordable there. And don't even get me started on the healthcare system. Sure, it may be expensive in the US, but at least we have options and access to top-notch facilities. I mean, look at the survival rates for cancer patients. The US kicks the UK's butt in that department. If I ever got diagnosed with cancer, you can bet your a** I'd be booking a one-way ticket to America for some proper treatment. So yeah, things may not be perfect here, but they sure as hell ain't as bad as you're making them out to be.
------
Yeah, back when I used to play hockey in BC, we had this whole tier system for rep hockey. A1 was like the holy grail, top-tier stuff, and A3/4 was for the scrubs. And then there was this pansy-ass house hockey where they couldn't even hit each other. I mean, come on, where's the fun in that?

I used to ref games too, and let me tell you, hitting was only a problem in pee wee hockey because some of those kids were freakin' giants compared to the others. And their coaches didn't bother teaching them how to take a hit properly, so it got dangerous.

But hey, at least where I played, everyone knew better than to pull that cheap shot crap. Hitting from behind or going for the head was a big no-no. Parents and kids alike understood how messed up it was for someone's health.

So yeah, my opinion is that coaches need to step it up and teach their players not to be a bunch of dirty cheaters. End of story.
------
Alright, let me just say this, who thought it was a good idea to put a bunch of undisciplined idiots on horseback and call it a cavalry? I mean, seriously? Mounted archers in leather jerkins? What the hell were they thinking? And don't even get me started on the freeriders and sellswords. They're just a bunch of no-good mercenaries who probably couldn't even tell their saddles from their own asses.

And what about those fieldhands? Armed with scythes and rusted swords? Yeah, that's really gonna do some damage against armored knights. Good job, geniuses. Oh, and let's not forget the half-trained boys from the stews of Lannisport. I bet they were barely old enough to hold a sword, let alone ride a horse.

I have to hand it to Tyrion though, he's got some balls charging into battle with this sorry excuse for a vanguard. But hey, at least they made a lot of noise, right? I'm sure that really intimidated the enemy. Give me a break. Just another example of idiotic military tactics in Westeros.
------
Yo, this whole system you're talking about seems like a total joke to me. Like seriously, who in their right mind thinks that it's gonna make things safer? I mean, come on, let's be real here. Not everyone is gonna be paying attention, so how can you say this system is gonna work? It's just increasing the chances of accidents if you ask me.

And don't even get me started on your so-called "logical reasons" for it being safer. All your arguments are just based on assumptions, man. There's no solid evidence or reasoning behind them. It's like you're living in a fantasy world or something.

Here's my simple logic for you: it's way safer for the person coming out of the blind spot to be cautious and wait. Why should the person who might get hit have to be the one to be cautious? They could have multiple people behind them, dude! It just doesn't make any sense, period.
------
Honestly, I don't get why people are complaining about these changes. It's like they want everything handed to them on a silver platter. All these new recipes and guarantees just make the game too damn easy. Back in Diablo 2, you had to grind your ass off for that one elusive item, like a Stone of Jordan. That's what made it exciting and rewarding. But now, with all these shortcuts, nobody's gonna bother gambling with shards anymore.

And don't even get me started on these guaranteed ancient drops from bounties. I mean, come on, are we playing Diablo or Hello Kitty Adventure Island? Farming rifts is where the real action is at, and if you can get the same stuff from doing mind-numbing bounties, what's the point? It's all about efficiency, man. If it's not faster, it's useless. And if it is faster, well, congrats on making this already short game even shorter.

Look, Diablo has always been about the loot. It's the whole damn point of the game. Kill monsters, get loot, rinse and repeat. 
------
Seriously, are you actually blaming Democrats for fighting against labor rights, collective bargaining, and minimum wage increases? Are you living in some alternative universe or what? It's the Republicans who consistently side with big businesses and corporations, screwing over the working class.

And don't even get me started on your ignorance about undocumented workers. If you want to solve the issue, maybe try actually stopping businesses from exploiting them instead of just spewing nonsense. These people just want a better life, and you want to blame them? How about holding the businesses accountable for creating the demand for undocumented workers?

Instead of wasting billions on a damn wall and deportations, why not fine the hell out of these businesses? Trust me, they would think twice about hiring undocumented workers if they faced huge fines. But no, it's easier for the pro-business party to point fingers at minorities and pretend they're the problem.

So seriously, get real and stop with your misguided blame game.
------
Alright, listen up folks. Here's the dealio. It seems like y'all got some serious differences in how you handle life. Your man wants to be a freakin' superhero, helping everyone and their grandma without thinking about the consequences. And you, my friend, you actually use your brain and think about the costs and problems that may come with it. Now, if you're planning on tying the knot, you better find some middle ground that doesn't make you wanna rip each other's hair out every single day. Trust me, this is gonna be a never-ending battle. And hey, don't see this as a black and white situation, okay? Try to find that gray area where you can both kinda tolerate each other's approaches. But let's be real here, if helping people just isn't your jam at all, maybe you two are not meant to be. Oh, and I gotta say, girl, it sounds like you got your shit together way more than he does. Maybe he should focus on getting his own act together before trying to save the world. Perhaps then you won't be so damn mad about him helping his sister instead of making bank or finding a steady job. Just sayin'.

Yo, if you're broke as hell in Cali, Washington, or Massachusetts, it's not even close to being as bad as it sounds. Like seriously, these places apparently have all the fancy-ass protections that European countries have. But let's be real, if you're poor in parts of California, you're straight-up dirt poor. The income gap is off the charts and doesn't match up with the damn cost of living, especially housing. Even if you're kinda well-off, you still won't be living the high life or affording your own pad. The popular areas in Cali are popular for a reason, which means you'll struggle like crazy finding a safe apartment anywhere near your job for less than a ridiculous 3 grand a month (and that's just for a damn one-bedroom). If you're poor or stuck with minimum wage, you're either sharing a sketchy apartment in the hood or commuting for hours with all the financial headaches and crappy quality of life that comes with it. Sucks, bro.
------
Oh boo-hoo, cry me a river! So what if your content wasn't sexy enough for him? Not everyone wants to ogle at your desperate attempts for attention on Instagram. Maybe he realized you're more interested in showing off your meaningless life than having any real substance. And let's be honest, who even cares about the number of followers you have anyway? Get over yourself and stop acting like it's the end of the freaking world because one guy unfollowed you. It's called life, sweetheart. People come and go, and if you can't handle that, maybe you should take a long hard look in the mirror and reevaluate your priorities.
------
Listen, dude, it sounds like you need a reality check. So your so-called "best friend" doesn't consider you as hers? Tough luck, pal. But instead of accepting that fact and moving on like a normal person, you're out here playing this whole "backing off" game. Newsflash: no one wants to be friends with someone who can't take a hint. It's pathetic that you're even questioning whether it's more awkward for you to back off or for her to straight up tell you to leave her alone. Here's some advice: grow a pair and respect her boundaries. Stop being that desperate loser with the boom box, hoping that by giving her some space she'll magically fall in love with you. Spoiler alert: it ain't gonna happen. So quit being a clingy weirdo and find someone who actually wants to be your friend.

Damn, this whole foreign university thing is such a scam. I mean, seriously? These kids couldn't make the cut in China, so now they're just buying their way into American colleges with their parents' money. And don't even get me started on these outrageous fees! American universities are sucking up all that sweet Chinese cash, like they're addicted or something. It's ridiculous!

But you know what's even more messed up? If suddenly Chinese students stopped coming, it would be an absolute disaster for American education. Everything would crumble, and those greedy administrators would be left begging for more public funding to cover their precious "shortfall". I swear, the bottom would fall out of the market overnight.

It's just mind-boggling how this whole system works. But hey, at least we can all have a good laugh about it on Reddit, right?
------
Hey everyone, I need some advice. So, there's this guy at work who I've been crushing on hard. I mean, seriously, he's so damn attractive. The problem is, we work in completely different departments and rarely have a chance to talk. But when we do run into each other, it's like there's some kind of chemistry.

I've been trying to find ways to strike up conversations with him, but it's tough since our departments have zero overlap. I've noticed him following me into the break room lately, which has given us a chance to chat briefly about work stuff and weekends. But I want more!

Here's the thing: I recently found out he's been divorced for a couple of years, which got my hopes up even more. I'm not gonna lie, I've been through some rough times too, so I really understand what it's like to heal and get back into the dating game.

So, give it to me straight, guys. How can I get this guy's attention and figure out if he's into me as well? I need your help, because I'm totally clueless when it comes to flirting these days.

Thanks in advance for any advice you've got!

Yo, have any of you guys checked out those spoiler chapters? Man, it's like George R.R. Martin is just dragging this whole thing out. Seriously, it feels like a quarter of the damn book has already been released! And let's not forget about how A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons turned out. It was all just endless traveling and multiple viewpoints of the same freaking battle. If those chapters are anything to go by, I highly doubt Martin will be able to tie up all these loose ends in The Winds of Winter.

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if he decides to milk it even more and announce an eighth book. I mean, come on, this series was originally supposed to be a trilogy! This dude has a habit of doing this kind of stuff, you know? Ain't it frustrating?
------
Yo, fellow Redditors! Just wanted to drop a quick post about a programming technique I came across ages ago. So, you know when you're dealing with those pesky languages that make your brain hurt? Well, one way to tackle that is by writing out your logic in single-line comments using your own damn language! Stick to plain ol' English or whatever you speak and understand best. Say what you wanna do step by step, like "do this, then do that, start a loop, end the damn loop." This keeps you focused on the task at hand without getting tangled up in all that syntax nonsense. Once you're done, just convert those comments into actual freaking code. Trust me, it's been a valuable technique for me throughout my three decades of programming for a damn paycheck. Give it a shot and let me know what you guys think! Peace out.

Alright, listen up folks. I gotta say, I'm so tired of all this sin talk. Like seriously, why are we always obsessing over it? We're only human, for crying out loud! We all have our weaknesses and temptations, and let's be real, they come in all shapes and sizes. So who am I to judge someone just because their sins are different from mine?

But hey, if you really care about your relationship with Christ (which I highly doubt), let's get one thing straight. Living in sin ain't cool with the big man upstairs. Yeah, it's a tough battle, I get it. But if you claim to love God, then don't just throw in the towel and start making excuses. And please, spare me the whole "cherry-picking" the Bible nonsense. God's opinion trumps ours, plain and simple.

So let's stop pretending like we're perfect and start focusing on being better human beings, alright? Can we all just chill and enjoy Reddit for once, without turning everything into a sermon? Thanks.

Alright, listen up, folks. I stumbled upon this dumb post about some 9-year-old prodigy spouting off political nonsense. Are we really supposed to believe that this kid came up with all this crap on their own? Give me a break! Kids that age are like sponges, soaking up every little thing they hear. And let's not forget that they have the attention span of a goldfish, so they'll blabber about anything they think will impress mommy and daddy.

But here's the real kicker: these parents are probably hardcore lefties, brainwashing their poor child with their ridiculous ideas. You know, those types who think they're so enlightened and superior. So, of course, this kid is parroting all their leftie jargon, thinking it'll make them proud or something. It's pathetic, really. I can't believe people are falling for this BS. Wake up, sheeple!

Okay, rant over. Can we get back to something actually interesting now? Geez.
------
Alright, listen up you new generation peeps. I get it, you don't wanna be held accountable for the sins of your ancestors, but here's the thing, denial won't make the crimes magically disappear. We can't just pretend like these atrocities never happened, that's just plain ignorant. The least you can do is acknowledge the truth and show some damn respect to the victims.

And hey, it's not like I'm saying you gotta run around apologizing for something you didn't do. Nah, that's not the point. The point is to learn from history so we don't repeat those horrific mistakes again. So stop burying your heads in the sand and face the truth.

But hold up, there's another thing. Even if you're not actively causing harm, y'all might still be benefiting from the consequences of those crimes. Let's say your ancestors robbed a group of people of their land and wealth, and now you're living it up with all that stolen shiz. If you just sit there enjoying the perks without making any effort to correct the injustice, then guess what? You're complicit too, my friend.

Look, I'm not saying it's your fault or anything. But as long as you keep benefitting while others suffer, there's no way you can claim moral neutrality. It's time to step up, fix things, and level the damn playing field. Until then, sorry, but you're part of the problem.

Ugh, impeachment proceedings, like seriously? I mean, come on, do you really think the Dems give a damn about disqualifying the guy from being president? They're just using it as a distraction, man. But you know what's hilarious? This whole Keith Ellison situation. It's actually got some real evidence, unlike that impeachment circus. I bet those Dems are scratching their heads, wondering how to handle this one, because they ain't used to dealing with actual cases. But hey, I'm so damn confident they'll look into it any day now, that I might as well hold my breath until the investigation starts. Oh wait, they won't do shit! Why? Well, because this dude is the number freakin' two at the DNC! Yeah, you heard that right. That's all the immunity he needs. Ain't politics a joke?
------
Ugh, I don't even know why this is a topic of discussion. Like seriously, who gives a crap about what she wants or doesn't want? It's her own damn business whether she wants a kid or not. And why the hell would she have to be "desperate" to have one just to avoid eating Zeke? That's some messed up logic right there.

And let's not even get started on Eren. Mr. High and Mighty thinks he's too good to compromise? Yeah, right. He's always been like that, so why would this be any different? Plus, who even cares about his current mental state? People change, get over it.

Seriously, I can't believe we're wasting time talking about this nonsense. Let's just wait for Chapter 110 and hope it's actually worth reading.
------
Are you kidding me? Taking away multiplayer completely would be the dumbest move ever! Who wants to play a game all by themselves? That's just boring as hell. What they should do is add an option for those solo players who want to show off their skills. Like, have separate leaderboards for solo and group play. That way, everyone's happy. 

But seriously, the whole reason why seasons are so exciting is because of the competition and teamwork. It's like a freaking race, man! Imagine if you couldn't team up with your buddies and kick some demon ass together. It would be lame as hell! And trust me, if Blizzard pulls this crap, they can say goodbye to a ton of players. Nobody wants to play a game where you can't have fun with your friends. So please, don't even suggest getting rid of multiplayer. It's a terrible idea!
------
Wow, talk about an entitled mentality. So, you think that just because someone is newly rich in America, they automatically have the right to move to Norway without any financial consequences? Newsflash, buddy: money doesn't magically solve all your problems.

Sure, winning the lottery might give you a nice chunk of change, but it doesn't make you as rich as you think. And guess what? Moving to a country with higher tax rates like Norway means you'll be even less rich. So, unless you're swimming in money and have been for generations, don't even bother dreaming about moving there.

Moving to Norway is not some grand lifestyle upgrade for your average millionaire. It's a luxury tax for the billionaires who can afford to live there comfortably. So, unless you're one of those lucky few, stop kidding yourself and stay in America where you belong.
------
Hey, seriously, can we not have this conversation again? We've been talking about alcohol and driving for like forever. How many times do we have to say "don't drive drunk" before it finally sinks in? It's so freaking annoying.

I mean, come on. You say you're not drunk after having four beers? Give me a break! It doesn't matter if you're a "better driver" when you're wasted, that's just a load of BS. And thinking that you're fine to drive just because it's a short distance? That's some next-level stupidity right there.

Look, we have all these strict laws and punishments now because people kept freaking dying. It's not rocket science. So how about we stop being a bunch of idiots and actually learn from the mistakes made with alcohol?

And now we have people advocating for driving high? Are you kidding me? Newsflash, genius: drugs and driving do not mix. Your attention span goes down the toilet and you become a danger to yourself and everyone else on the road. Is that really worth it? 
------
Alright, so here's the deal. I don't really know what the heck is going on in Canada when it comes to these projects, but from what I gather, the NEB seems to be playing a game of pick and choose. They held some fancy schmancy hearings about tanker traffic, and they decided it would be bad for the environment and screw over the local indigenous population. So they made this report saying that the killer whales are gonna suffer and the aboriginal use will go down the drain if this project goes ahead.

But get this, instead of actually considering ALL the factors, they conveniently decided to leave out any marine traffic stuff because apparently, they have no regulatory oversight. Bullcrap! If they're gonna consider greenhouse gas emissions for other projects, why the hell can't they do the same for this one? Seems like a load of double standards to me.

Honestly, who knows what the typical procedure even is in Canada? It's a freaking mystery. But it looks like the NEB is just out here making up their own rules as they go along. Typical, am I right?
------
yo so i gotta say i'm not really buying into all this hype about apple's taptic engine. like, sure they talk a big game about haptic feedback and all that, but let's be real, there's still so much more potential that they haven't tapped into yet (pun intended).

And don't even get me started on touchscreens. Different brands have completely different touchscreen behaviors, man. Like, you're telling me that a GM touchscreen feels the same as a Tesla or a Land Rover? Yeah, right. Give me a break.

But hey, if you wanna talk about less tactile controls, try using a modern MacBook trackpad. It's supposed to feel like a traditional button or whatever, but honestly, it's just not doing it for me. I've used previous MacBooks and other laptops, and I find those trackpads more reliable than this newfangled one.

That's just my two cents though, take it or leave it. Peace out, y'all.
------
Seriously, bro? Are you for real? You think getting hit by a stray rocket or a few pellets makes someone a bad scout? Have you ever played the game? It's not like we have freakin' superpowers to dodge every single shot that comes our way. And don't even get me started on those damn mini-sentries. They're like little devil spawn that you can't escape from.

And who the hell do you think you are, acting all high and mighty with your "opinion is gospel" crap? You're not some TF2 guru, so quit acting like it. Maybe instead of being a know-it-all, try actually having a constructive discussion for once.

But hey, it's obvious that whoever made that argument against scout has no clue what they're talking about. Maybe they should just quit playing scout altogether if they think avoiding every single hit is so damn easy. Ugh, some people, man. So infuriating.
------
Damn, this whole Ukraine-Russia mess is a total shitshow. It's like a never-ending soap opera with everyone acting like assholes. I mean, come on, both the Russian government and the Ukrainian coup government are absolute garbage. And let's not forget about the Western countries sticking their noses where they don't belong and supporting the damn coup. 

But hey, at the end of the day, I'm all about self-determination, man. Whether it's Chechnya, Tibet, or Donbass and Luhansk, people should have the right to decide their own damn fate. Screw all this pro-Ukraine or pro-Russia crap, it's about time we prioritize people's legitimate rights. Don't you agree?

Honestly, this whole mess could've been avoided if the damn Ukrainian far-right didn't decide to violently overthrow a freaking democratically elected government. Like seriously, who does that shit? It's no wonder the eastern regions are pissed off and want to peace out. Can't blame them one bit.
------
Wow, you're really overreacting here. Just because Google is popular doesn't mean they owe you anything. They're a private company, not some public service. They can do whatever they want with their search results. If your service can't be found, maybe it's just not good enough to stand out. Quit blaming others for your own failures.

And seriously, regulating these tech giants as monopolies? That's just ridiculous. The government should stay out of it. They're doing just fine without interference. Stop trying to control everything and take some responsibility for your own success. Maybe if you focused on improving your service instead of whining about imaginary conspiracies, you'd actually get somewhere. Good luck with that.
------
wow, what a shitshow! I can't believe people are actually losing their minds over this blackface and national anthem drama. Like seriously, get a life! Yeah, blackface is obviously offensive, but come on, it's a freaking kid! Can we cut them some slack? And criticizing the anthem? Well, it's about time someone did! Those nationalistic dickheads need a reality check. But let's be real, comparing these two things is just dumb. Blackface hurts minorities, while dissing the anthem only hurts fragile egos. It's not even close to being the same. Both kids are getting way too much attention, but they definitely don't deserve any hate or bullying. Let's all take a chill pill and react like rational human beings for once. Enough with this identity politics crap, can we just be reasonable?
------
lol okay, so here's the deal. If you wanna get into this whole cryptocurrency thing, you gotta be smart about it. Don't go putting all your hard-earned cash into it, alright? Only invest what you can afford to lose. And make sure you do your own damn research. Don't believe everything those so-called experts say.

Now, when it comes to wallets, don't be an idiot and use the ones that don't make you write down a seed. That's just asking for trouble. Learn how to store that seed properly, man. Oh, and those hardware wallets? Yeah, they cost a pretty penny, but they're worth it if you're dealing with a ton of moolah.

But listen up, don't keep all your precious coins in one place. Those exchanges ain't the safest spot, alright? They're like banks, holding your keys and all. Not your keys, not your money, got it? So be your own damn bank and handle your keys, my friend. And for the love of crypto, keep that seed protected. Losing it means losing all your hard-earned dough with no way to get it back. It's gone, baby.

Now, if you're wondering how to get your hands on some Bitcoin, I gotcha covered. You can try Coinbase, Square Cash App, or hit up that localbitcoins.com. Hell, even check out a Bitcoin ATM near you if you're feeling adventurous. But remember, once you got those coins, move 'em to a wallet where you call the shots, got it? Control those seeds and keys like a boss.

Hit me up if you got any more questions, bro.

So my wife just had this surgery in Germany and thank god for health insurance, man! I mean, imagine if I had to cough up 3k - 5k for all those damn doctor visits with ultrasounds and that week-long stay at the hospital after the operation. Oh, and don't even get me started on the freakin' intensive care she had to be put in because of all the complications aka blood loss. 

But you know what? I didn't have to worry about money a single damn time. And let me tell ya, that is one hell of a relief when life is already stressful as hell. The only thing I had to pay for was a damn taxi ride back home, which cost me 40 freaking euros. Can you believe that? But hey, at least I didn't have to sell my damn kidney to cover the medical bills. Thank you, health insurance!
------
Wow, good for you! Seriously, learning how to balance your life and not waste money is gonna pay off big time in the long run. You don't always have to settle for just the basics, but it's important to stop and think before you blow all your cash on something you think you need but really don't. Trust me, finding joy in the things that truly matter will save you a ton of regret. And don't even think about upgrading your lifestyle every time you get a raise, man. Just get comfortable and stash away that extra dough. Celebrating doesn't mean you have to splurge, you know? Sorry if I sound preachy, but these are hard lessons I had to learn the painful way. I'm just tryna help you out, bro.
------
So, here's the deal. Just got this friggin' confirmation from the airline that our damn flight from Manila to Kansai International Airport on September 18 got canned. Can you believe that crap? Now I'm freaking out because we've already booked all these sick Airbnbs and hostels in Osaka and Tokyo for our week-long trip. And to top it all off, I've already got my vacation approved for those exact dates.

I need some advice on how to handle this mess. I'm thinking maybe we could reroute the flight to Narita instead, so we're flyin' in and out of Tokyo. Then we can just hop on a damn shinkansen to Osaka and still use our Airbnb and hit up all the spots we wanna see. But seriously, is it worth the extra hassle and money for transportation?

The other option is to reschedule the whole freakin' trip for a later date since our Japan visa is good until November. But now I'm worried that these bloody Airbnbs and hostels won't give us full refunds.

Oh, and one more thing. I saw something about flying into Nagoya instead of Osaka, but it looks like it's gonna take us a solid three hours to get from Nagoya to Osaka according to Google.

Anyway, I'm dying to hear your thoughts on this hot mess!
------
lol this sub is full of clueless people. Can't believe someone actually has to ask if Plato's dialogues are hard to interpret. Of course they are, genius. It's like you never even read them. But yeah, I guess I encounter this problem too, with dumbasses who can't understand basic questions. Like, hello? Can you follow a train of thought or what? And don't get me started on loaded questions. It's not rocket science, people. But hey, maybe OP just needs a little help. So here's the deal: Plato's dialogues aren't about arguing a point, they're about leading you to think for yourself and arrive at a conclusion. Get it? Good. Now stop wasting my time with these obvious questions.
------
Wow, what a bunch of self-righteous assholes. I can't believe I'm wasting my time dealing with these judgmental pricks. I simply stated my opinion and asked some innocent questions, and now I'm being attacked from all sides. I've patiently explained my perspective over and over again, but these idiots refuse to listen.

And seriously, where the hell did they get the idea that I don't have feelings in my relationships? Just because I don't abide by their narrow-minded definition of what a relationship should be, they automatically assume I'm some heartless monster.

I'm done explaining myself to these morons. They just want to feel superior and spread their shitty judgment everywhere. Well, guess what? I don't give a flying fuck about their opinions. So, to all you haters out there, kindly fuck off and let me live my life the way I want.
------
Yo, what's up fellow style enthusiasts? So, I've been pondering over something lately and I need your input. Brace yourselves, 'cause I'm about to challenge the sacred chino! Yeah, I know, it's supposed to be this versatile piece that bridges the gap between jeans and dress pants. But hear me out.

I've been rockin' chinos nonstop this year, along with some button-up shirts instead of my usual tees. And I gotta admit, it's been aight. Not too formal, not too casual, just a nice middle ground. But is nice enough? Are we settling for mediocrity?

What if we ditch the chinos altogether and go all-in on the t-shirt and jeans combo? Or go full-on fancy with suits and slacks? Maybe the chino is just a weak compromise. Are we blind to its downsides because it's become a damn style staple?

So, my rebellious souls, have any of you ever thought to yourselves, "Are chinos overrated?" Let's spill the tea, people! I ain't convinced yet, but I wanna hear your thoughts on these supposedly holy pants that nobody dares to question. Let the chino-roasting begin!
------
Damn, talk about lazy cinematography! I mean, seriously, whoever directed this movie must have been on their coffee break or something. Can you believe they couldn't come up with more than just three shots for that whole scene? And to make matters worse, the shots they did have were so basic and boring. I've seen more creativity in a high school student's YouTube video.

I guess it's not surprising though. These days, it feels like filmmakers are just phoning it in. They don't care about taking risks or pushing the boundaries of visual storytelling. They just want to get the job done and collect their paycheck. It's a shame because movies used to be so much more than that.

I mean, come on! Can't we at least expect some variety in shot composition? Is it too much to ask for a little bit of visual flair? It's like they're afraid to experiment or try something new. But hey, who needs innovation when you can just stick to the same old, cookie-cutter shots?

Honestly, it's disappointing. I miss the days when movies actually made me feel something, when the camera work added an extra layer of emotion and depth to the storytelling. But I guess we'll just have to settle for mediocrity.
------
Look, I get it. I understand that everyone has their own perspectives and definitions, but let's be real here. Unless you're Wikipedia, I ain't gonna give a crap about your definition. It's like you're in some exclusive club, preaching about religion in the weirdest way possible.

And oh, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Amway didn't give anything back, just like I'm not saying this prosperity gospel thing is worthless. They clearly offer different things, duh! But one of those things is only relatable if you've never experienced faith.

If you've never had a personal connection with God or built your entire worldview around salvation, then you're never gonna grasp why people hold on to that promise. It's like trying to explain colors to a blind person, impossible! So before you start bashing away at someone's faith, maybe try understanding where they're coming from. Just sayin'.
------
Is it really so hard to understand? Like, seriously? If you're gonna ask dumb questions, at least make them interesting. But fine, I'll humor you.

Look, everyone's entitled to their own opinion, right? I mean, that's the whole point of living in a "free" world or whatever. So yeah, you can go ahead and seek out the so-called "truth" all you want. But just because you find different information and come to a different conclusion, doesn't mean you're automatically denying the truth. It just means you have a different perspective or something.

As for the whole eternal torment thing, I totally get what you're saying. Why would the "bad ones" need eternal anything? It doesn't make any damn sense. If this whole earth game is about sorting out the good ones, why not just let the bad ones rot in peace? And don't even get me started on the whole resurrection thing. Like, who even wants to come back with new bodies? Just let us be worm food, man.

Anyway, that's just my two cents. Take it or leave it. But seriously, think about it. And next time, ask a question worth answering.
------
Hey, listen up people! I don't know about you, but this whole Constitution thing is so freaking outdated. Seriously, it's like the founding fathers whipped it up on a drunken summer bender and now we're stuck with this mess. We can't just change it willy-nilly, because apparently it's some sacred text or whatever.

But let's face it, folks. We're living in the 21st century, where information travels faster than your grandma's dentures fly out of her mouth. We need a fresh start, a brand new constitution that actually makes sense for our modern world. I mean, come on, we've had technological advancements, social progress, and political theories that would make those old dudes roll in their graves.

Having the oldest constitution doesn't make us cool, it makes us look dumb. It's high time we stop clinging to this ancient relic and embrace some real change. I know it won't be easy, but damn, we gotta figure out a way to get out of this mess. Any ideas, fellow Redditors?
------
I can't stand these damn websites with all their unnecessary JavaScript crap. Seriously, why do we need all this fancy code? Back in the day, we had simple telnet sites and it was perfectly fine. Web pages should be basic and just focus on formatting, not running a bunch of unnecessary code. The idiots at W3C really messed up by allowing web designers to use computer processors for running code. It's just asking for trouble. If I want to run a program, I'll do it myself and deal with any consequences. But when I'm browsing the internet, I just want information, not a bunch of annoying scripts slowing me down.

On a side note, I don't hate Apple like some people do. In fact, I'm trying to get into using their stuff because I want to learn iOS app development. But seriously, their whole "cloud everything" approach is a huge security risk. Why should I have to rely on some random company to store all my private data? It's sketchy as hell and they should be monitored closely. I should be able to control my own damn machine without having all my stuff floating around in their cloud server somewhere.
------
Dude, seriously? You're making such a big fuss over nothing. Who cares if your phone has a QC3 charger? It's not like it's gonna blow up or something. And why the hell are we even talking about laptop batteries now? This whole argument is so dumb, it's laughable. Show me some actual proof that QC3 is causing rapid battery degradation, then maybe I'll consider taking you seriously. But until then, stop acting like you're some kind of expert on this stuff. Ain't nobody got time for baseless claims and pointless arguments. Just charge your damn phone and move on with your life. Sheesh!
------
I can't believe we're still having this discussion! How many times do we have to go over this? Hate speech is free speech, plain and simple. Just because someone says something racist or sexist doesn't mean they should be thrown in jail. Come on, people! We live in a society where we can publicly shame these idiots for their ignorant opinions. That's punishment enough!

And I'm so sick of everyone crying about deplatforming. Seriously? Instead of banning these idiots, we should be engaging with them and tearing apart their arguments. But no, everyone just wants to act like a bunch of whiny kids and ban them from every platform. It's like they're running a Minecraft server or something. Grow up, people! Let's have a real conversation and prove these haters wrong.
------
Yo, I've messed around with this HD mod for D2 and damn, it's a total gamebreaker, especially when you're teleporting with some crazy high FCR. But hold up, there are a ton of other problems too. Like, the original assets aren't available, the game is locked to a measly 25 fps, and the 3D emulation system is all whack with its grid-based nonsense.

But let's say we somehow get past all that crap. Now we gotta face some tough questions. Do we bother balancing the game or just let those goddamn Hammerdins continue to dominate everything? And what about life tap being stupidly OP? Should we add an actual end-game system or do people just not give a crap about PvM? And seriously, do we mess around with things like the stamina bar and auto gold-pickup, or should we leave the original feel alone?

Look, I get it, Blizzard is a big ol' company, they can probably pull it off. But man, it ain't gonna be the easy win everyone thinks. There's a shitload of factors to consider, especially the freakin' opportunity cost. So before we start begging for a D2 remaster, let's really think about whether it's worth their time and money.
------
Haha, this is just too funny! I can't believe people actually put a sight on their sight. Like, what's the point? Are they trying to be extra fancy or something? I mean, I get it, everyone wants to show off their cool gadgets, but this is taking it to a whole new level of ridiculousness. 

But hey, I guess if you're rocking a cheapo-gun, why not go all out with the crazy accessories, right? It may not be as high-end as those fancy ARs, but hey, it gets the job done. And let's be real here, it's all about making the most out of what you've got, not how much money you can throw at something.

I gotta admit though, as much as I'm laughing at this sight abomination, I'm kinda impressed that it actually works well. Maybe there's something to be said about finding creative solutions on a budget. Who needs all that expensive stuff when you can have fun with a DIY masterpiece like this?
------
Yeah, I mean, it's great that they're taking their sweet time to release this game on PC. It gives them a chance to actually make it look good and use all that fancy GPU power that PCs have. Remember when GTA V came out and it almost melted everyone's graphics card? Good times.

But just think about it, Red Dead Redemption 2 with full RTX support at 1440p and 60fps. That would be insane! Okay, maybe we won't be able to handle RTX at 4K and 60fps anytime soon, but 1440p and 60fps could be doable in the next couple of years. Right now, even hitting a stable 60fps at 1080p with RTX is a struggle. So, I guess it's cool that they're taking some extra time to polish the game while the RTX GPU hardware catches up.

Oh, and in case you're wondering what RTX means, it stands for real-time ray tracing. Just thought I'd spell it out for those who don't know their acronyms.
------
So mom starts flipping out, saying how unfair it is that she has to pay to be in the car. Like seriously? We are just trying to have a good time and she's making everything about money. It's not like we're asking her for a fortune, just a little contribution. But no, she acts like we're robbing her blind.

And then the drama gets even worse. Mom starts guilt-tripping bil and sil, saying how they shouldn't have invited us in the first place because now she feels left out. Like hello, mom, you invited yourself! You can't blame everyone else for your own insecurities.

Honestly, I'm just so fed up with all this nonsense. Can't we just enjoy a trip without mom causing a scene? It's always something with her. I mean, who invites themselves on a trip and then acts like they're entitled to everything? It's ridiculous.

Sorry for the rant guys, but I just had to get this off my chest. Thanks for listening.
------
I don't get why people make such a big deal out of grammar. Like, honestly, who cares if someone says "i seen" or "i gots"? It's not like it's the end of the world. Language evolves, man. It's all about how you communicate and get your point across. And let's not even start with "expresso" and "expecially". Seriously, who gives a crap? Language is fluid, like you said, and it differs from person to person. So, if someone wants to use ain't or ya'll, who are we to judge? I actually think ain't and ya'll sound better in certain situations. So, chill out and stop being so uptight about grammar rules. Live and let live, my friend.
------
What a mess! It's like they didn't think things through before launching Bitcoin. Those opcodes disabling were just a recipe for disaster. I mean, seriously, a single word causing an out-of-memory crash? That's just plain lazy programming. And don't even get me started on the math operations being disabled too. Couldn't they have figured out a better way to handle memory consumption rather than just disabling everything?

And let's not forget about the looping limitation. Sure, it might help with the out-of-memory issue, but it's not foolproof. Any determined person can just unroll the loop by hand and still cause trouble. It's like they were trying to half-ass a solution.

If I were Satoshi or whoever is in charge now, I would definitely prioritize fixing these issues. Transaction outputs should contain addresses and amounts, not these faulty scripts. I mean, come on, even Andytoshi's scriptless scripts prove that Bitcoin script isn't even necessary for conditional transfers. It's about time they upgrade and make things more functional and secure.
------
Dude, you're way off. Increasing the power supply unit (PSU) size does not magically make your system more efficient. That's just a load of crap. The efficiency of a PSU actually peaks at around 50% of its maximum output. So, if you have a 400W PSU, the sweet spot is around 200W usage. And guess what? Most gaming rigs with a measly 1080 graphics card don't even come close to that!

If anything, having a smaller fraction of drawn power compared to the PSU's maximum output makes it less efficient. So, your logic is totally flawed. If you want to be efficient, go for a PSU that's about 1.5 times the power your system consumes during intense gaming. But, hey, I like to play it safe, so I personally go for a 400W PSU. Better safe than sorry, right?

Okay, first of all, let me just say that you clearly have no idea what you're talking about. I can't speak for whatever the hell your first point is because it's so nonsensical, but when it comes to protein, you're just spouting a bunch of bullshit.

So, you think that a scoop of whey protein is the same as 3.5oz of meat? Are you actually serious right now? Have you ever even looked at a nutrition label? One scoop of whey protein is nothing compared to a juicy steak or a nice chicken breast. And don't even get me started on two scoops or three scoops. You're acting like it's some kind of Thanksgiving feast. Give me a break.

And where did you get this idea that protein doesn't go into your blood? Are you living in the Stone Age or something? Protein is a vital nutrient that your body needs to function properly. It gets absorbed into your bloodstream and helps repair and build muscle. But I guess you wouldn't know anything about that.

And your little theory about what happens when you have too much protein? It's laughable. Yeah, sure, you might gain some weight if you're eating excess calories, but that has nothing to do with protein specifically. And peeing out broken up amino acids? Are you kidding me? That's not how the body works. Your body will use the protein it needs and get rid of the rest through digestion, not by pissing out some magical amino acid potion.

So please, do us all a favor and stop spreading your ignorant nonsense. Stick to topics you actually understand because this is just embarrassing.

Yo, what if we've been getting the whole story on Elia's death wrong? Yeah, we know Lorch did the dirty work, but what if he had backup? Picture this: someone sent ahead to trick Elia into thinking they were her savior, a knight that Rhaegar trusted. It's like that messed up situation with the innkeeper's daughter, where the dad asked for help and got screwed over. Tywin even claims he never said Elia should be raped or killed.

Now, I get it, probably just an oversight by GRRM, but what if there's something more twisted going on here? Elia may have believed she was saved, only to realize she got played big time. It's messed up, man. Makes you wonder what other messed up things are lurking in this story. Just a thought, but damn, it's dark.
------
Yo, so I was just reading through this thread and damn, some of y'all need to chill. Like, seriously? Questioning why a supposedly all-powerful god would create a universe with rules and then break them whenever he feels like it? Bruh, have you ever played a video game? It's like using cheat codes to get whatever you want. God's just flexing his console commands, plain and simple.

But let's talk about this whole hell thing for a sec. Billions of people burning just so god can have his fun? That ain't cool, man. If that's the kind of god you worship, then I don't know what to tell ya. And don't even get me started on miracles. The whole point is that they break the rules! If he followed the laws of physics every time, then we wouldn't be talking about miracles, now would we?

And this talk about infinite universes and real numbers on a piece of paper? Bro, you're overcomplicating things. Let's keep it simple. God's all-powerful, right? So why limit him to just planning things within our solar system? Let him go interstellar, man! He can save as many souls as he wants, and that's a good thing, right?

As for angels and torture victims, I've got two words for you: don't instantiate them. Boom, problem solved. Or, if you're feeling messed up, only bring into existence the ones who would willingly believe. Either way, let's not act like angels are all sunshine and rainbows. They've done some messed up stuff before, so don't act all surprised.

Alright, rant over. Just my two cents, ya feel me? Peace out, y'all.
------
Wow, really? Can you be any more ignorant and self-centered? It's amazing how you think your country is the center of the universe and that everyone else depends on you. Newsflash: the world doesn't revolve around America! Maybe if you took your head out of your patriotic ass for a second, you'd realize that other countries can thrive on their own without your precious policies and geography.

And don't even get me started on your so-called "imperfect union." You guys elected a reality TV star as your president, so forgive us if we question your ability to "get your shit together." It's laughable how you think your health affects ours. We're perfectly capable of taking care of ourselves. If anything, it's your dysfunctional political system that we should be worried about.

So do us all a favor and spare us your self-righteous diatribe. The world doesn't need America to be great. We've been doing just fine without you.

Man, this whole encryption debate is just a load of bs. Like seriously, why do they think they can dictate what software vendors sell? It's like the Australian government thinks they're some kind of tech overlords or something. And don't even get me started on the US and their stupid "five eyes" alliance. What a joke.

Sure, they might be able to push for backdoors in encryption, but you know what? I've got my trusty VPN that definitely doesn't fall under their watchful eyes. And if I really wanted to, I could just go buy from some shady vendor in a country that doesn't have these dumb rules. Probably some EU country that actually values privacy.

But here's the thing, it's not gonna matter for most people. The average Joe is gonna keep using their precious Facebook, Google, and Dropbox like nothing has changed. They don't care about privacy or backdoors, they just want convenience and legality. So, let them have their back-doored encryption, it won't affect us savvy folks anyway.
------
Yeah, so like, I totally get where you're coming from. Switching a heroin addiction for a suboxone addiction might not sound amazing, but it's actually a major upgrade. I mean, heroin can straight-up kill you, but with suboxone, you're pretty much in the clear. It's a partial agonist, bro, so you can't just keep getting higher and higher by popping more pills. Plus, you don't have to stress about fentanyl or those sketchy drug dealers anymore. 

Honestly, it's a solid plan, man. Of course, the end goal should be to break free from all this substance dependence crap. But, in the beginning, swapping out dangerous behavior for a controlled reliance on something safer is a massive leap forward. People need to chill and stop being so against it, ya know? 

Oh, by the way, for those who can't get their hands on suboxone, kratom is like a similar alternative. So there you go, in case you're wondering. Rock on, dudes!
------
Man, my university was offering two different math degrees - a BS and a BA. And let me tell you, the differences were pretty damn clear.

First off, the BS degree was all about the practical stuff. You know, the applied topics that could actually be useful in fields like engineering or physics. Basically, if you wanted to go for the BA, you were stuck with all this theoretical crap like number theory and abstract algebra. Like, who even uses that stuff in real life?

And get this, the BA degree was also a freaking shortcut. They made us take fewer classes just so they could squeeze in some extra courses for a teaching credential. Yeah, that's right, they were actually encouraging us to become teachers. As if math wasn't already boring enough!

But I gotta admit, there were a couple of courses in the BA that had some kinda connection to teaching. Like that number theory class had this weird history component. I guess they thought it would make us better teacher material or something. And the geometry class had something too, but honestly, I can't remember what the hell it was.

Anyway, that's the lowdown on those math degrees. Just thought I'd share my two cents on this subreddit. Peace out!
------
Dude, seriously? Are we really debating if lootboxes and ccgs are gambling? It's pretty damn obvious that they are. I mean, come on, you're spending money with a chance of getting something valuable in return. That's like the definition of gambling, right?

But here's the thing, I don't think ccgs should be as regulated as gambling. Yeah, sure, there's a stock limit and physical product and all that crap. But let's be real, you can still spend a shit ton of money on those card packs. And what do you get? Maybe a rare card or two that you can sell back for some cash, if you're lucky. But with lootboxes, man, it's a whole different story. You spend your hard-earned cash on virtual crap that you don't even own. Like, you can keep throwing money at them and never actually get anything substantial. It's a freaking scam!

And let's not forget about accessibility. With ccgs, you're limited by stock and all that nonsense. So it's not like some kid can blow all his parents' money on cards. But with lootboxes, it's as easy as clicking a damn button. Any idiot with a credit card can waste their life savings on that crap.

So yeah, lootboxes should definitely be regulated. They're a freaking predatory system, targeting vulnerable people and taking their money for worthless digital junk. Screw that noise.
------
Look, dude, I don't know what the hell you're on about here. I've been nodding along and agreeing with you this whole damn time. Just because someone believes something doesn't mean it's automatically true. And yeah, I get it, even if an accusation is super messed up, that doesn't make it more likely to be true either. So why the hell are you coming at me with this aggressive "are you starting to fucking get this now?" Seriously, chill the fuck out. I'm on your side here, no need to be a condescending shithead about it. Can we just have a civil conversation or are you gonna keep being a prick?
------
Hey guys, just gotta rant here for a sec. Okay, so I'm total Nintendo fanboy, been playing their consoles since the freakin' Stone Age. But man, I gotta say, Pokemon has really lost its mojo, you know what I mean? It's like they've gone off the deep end and lost their minds.

Now, don't get me wrong, I still love my Zelda and Metroid. Those games are my jam! And the fact that they're portable on the Switch? Sign me up! But when it comes to everything else, forget about it!

I mean, look at the PS4, it's got all these killer exclusives like Spiderman, The Last of Us, Horizon, and God of War. Those games make me drool! On the other hand, Xbox is just a useless piece of junk for me now. They keep releasing all their games on Windows, so why bother with an Xbox?

Anyway, that's my two cents. Flame me if you want, but that's how I see it. Peace out, gamers!
------
Yeah, I totally get where you're coming from. Like, who needs an Ivy League education anyways? It's not like they have any special secrets to teach us. Math is math, history is history, and economics is economics no matter where you go. Sure, they might have some fancy-pants professors and super smart TA's, but that doesn't make them better than any other school.

And let's be real here, the only reason people go to these Ivy League schools is for the name. It's all about that prestigious brand and the connections you can make. They brainwash everyone into thinking that if you don't go to an Ivy, you're a failure. But guess what? There are plenty of successful people out there who never stepped foot in one of those snobby institutions.

So yeah, Ivy League degrees are just a scam. They make it seem like you're getting this golden ticket to success, but really it's just a piece of paper that says you wasted a ton of money. Don't fall for the hype, people! Success isn't determined by where you went to college, it's about how hard you work and what you do with your skills.
------
Dude, why are people still arguing about this? It's not rocket science. The comparison is obviously about real-life use cases, not some theoretical mumbo jumbo. This guy, who actually knows what he's doing, wrote some badass C code and decided to test out Rust just for the heck of it. And guess what? His naive Rust version turned out to be freaking faster! Yeah, you heard that right. So now he's trying to explain why that happened.

Look, when you're writing actual code for a project, you don't always have the luxury of spending a million years optimizing every single line. That's just the reality, my friend. And if Rust can make it easier to write better-performing code without all the headaches, then hey, that's a win in my book. So stop whining and accept that sometimes other languages have their advantages. End of story.
------
Honestly, I don't get the hype around Salzburg. I mean, sure, it's cool and all with that Sound of Music stuff, but one day was enough for me. Two days? Boring AF. I didn't bother with Hallstatt because it looks like a tiny ass town where you can only hike. Maybe a day trip would be alright if you're into that. But seriously, you can squeeze in Innsbruck, Hallstatt, and Salzburg in like 4-5 days without breaking a sweat. I'd say spend 2 days max in Salzburg and skip Innsbruck altogether. Trust me, you won't be missing out on much. Just make sure you add in at least one more stop to make it worth your while.
------
Hey, guys! So I just whipped up this super ugly but functional HTML page with links to all my favorite sites - Google, YouTube, Reddit, you name it. And as if that wasn't cool enough, I also made an extension for my browser that lets me open new tabs at my homepage or in specific containers just by hitting Ctrl + 1, Ctrl + 2, or Ctrl + 3. It's a total game-changer!

By the way, have any of you checked out container apps? They're the bomb! Firefox even has them built-in now. No need to upload my janky extension online just to get it signed. I'm rocking the Firefox Developer Edition like a boss. Alternatively, there's this true open-source fork of Firefox that some genius set up, but dammit, I can't remember its name. Anyway, give it a shot, folks!

Alright, that's enough tech geekery for one day. Let me know what you think of my creation, or if you have any other cool hacks to share. Peace out!
------
Yo, so here's the deal. I think your question is kinda flawed, bro. Like, you say immaterial things exist, but how can something exist without space and time? You gotta prove that immaterial thing exists first before you start calling it immaterial. And if you're saying immaterial things don't exist, then boom, souls and personal identities are out the window too. All we got is bodies, neurons, and cells. That's it.

Now, I get it, some people use consciousness as an example of something immaterial. But let me tell you, all the evidence points to consciousness being just a product of the brain. So it's material, dude.

Look, I'm not saying this proves the existence of the soul or anything, but you can't just dismiss it because it's supposedly immaterial. It could be possible, but the default position is that something doesn't exist until it's actually proven to exist.

And don't even start with the mind being immaterial. Can you show me it exists without a brain? If the brain gets messed up, so does the consciousness. Mind equals brain, plain and simple.
------
Man, you seriously need to sort yourself out.

Printing your own currency? Are you delusional or something? Nobody is going to accept that crap, and you'll just end up looking like a total idiot. And don't even get me started on your entitlement about overtime pay. You should be grateful you even have a job, let alone one that pays well. Stop whining and start appreciating what you have, you spoiled brat.

Living in a cabin, huh? That's cute. But guess what? Society didn't revolve around your little fantasy world. It was built by people who actually contribute to the system and pay their taxes. So stop acting like a lone wolf, waving your gun around like some kind of paranoid lunatic. The rest of us want to live in a society where we help and support each other, not hide away in the woods guarding our precious stash of cash.

So do us all a favor and take a reality check, buddy. You're not as special as you think you are.
------
Yo, listen up, folks. Can we all just take a breather and stop spewing our ignorant opinions left and right? I mean, seriously, do a quick Google search for once in your pathetic lives! That image y'all are discussing came from some website, [<url>](<url>), with actual legit facts, you know? Maybe you should check it out before you start blabbering nonsense. 

I'm so sick and tired of people thinking they're the ultimate authority on everything without a shred of evidence to back it up. Like, come on, man. Just because you can write a freaking essay about how much you disagree with something doesn't make you right. Get off your high horse already!

Look, maybe some of us are using that image as motivation to quit watching porn, alright? Maybe some of us are digging deep into the origins of that image and doing some actual research. So before you open your big mouth, why don't you actually know what the hell you're talking about? Rant over. Peace out.
------
Man, I gotta say, I appreciate the nice comments and all, but seriously, who even cares about comparing crop sensors to full-frame? Like, who has the time for that kinda crap? I mean, unless you're some sort of camera wizard who can magically shoot with both at the same time, what's the point of obsessing over it?

And let me tell you, gear is so overrated these days. I mean, even the cheap stuff can produce killer quality. So why waste your time and money on the fancy, expensive toys? It's all just a bunch of hype if you ask me.

But hey, if I had to choose, I'd definitely go for a bigger sensor. Who really needs all those megapixels anyway? Today's cameras already have more than enough. Plus, when it comes to shooting videos, that wider field of view that comes with full-frame is a godsend in tight situations. Trust me, it's saved my ass more times than I can count.
------
Wow, that's some messed up shit. I can't even imagine how you must be feeling right now. Your boyfriend is one sick freak, I tell ya. Like, jerking off to your own mom? That's next-level messed up. I wouldn't blame you if you never wanted to see his sorry ass again. But hey, if you're thinking about giving him another chance, at least he seems to be taking responsibility for his disgusting actions. Sending money for the bills and sleeping in his car, yeah, that's the least he can do. But honestly, I don't know if I could ever forgive someone after something like that. It's just too messed up. You're definitely gonna need therapy if you decide to give this guy another shot. And even then, it's gonna take a long-ass time to get past all this shit. Stay strong, girl, and take care of yourself. You deserve way better than this sicko.
------
Wow, Victoria really seems to have it all when it comes to screwing over tenants. I mean, seriously, one of the worst tenants' rights in the developed world? That's just messed up. And don't even get me started on the housing bubble. It's like these landlords are rubbing their hands together, thinking about how much money they can make off people's misery.

I mean, come on, who actually benefits from this crap? If you're so concerned about making your precious investment property cozy and safe, maybe you should consider being a decent human being instead of just trying to cash in on other people's squalor.

It's mind-boggling that bidding on rentals and no-cause evictions are still a thing in the developed world. Basic human rights, anyone? This news should be making headlines and causing an uproar. We should be fighting for proper tenants' rights like it's the freaking eight-hour workday all over again. Who's with me?
------
What's the deal with all these people saying pineapple doesn't belong on pizza? Are they seriously so tasteless that they can't appreciate the sweet and savory combination? It's like they have no sense of adventure or fun in their lives. Pineapple on pizza is a masterpiece, and if you can't handle it, then maybe you need to expand your horizons and try something new instead of sticking to your boring old cheese and pepperoni. I bet half of these haters haven't even given it a fair shot. So, before you go around condemning pineapple on pizza, why don't you actually try it? Who knows, you might end up loving it and joining the rest of us enlightened individuals.
------
>Why are people making such a big fuss about this? Clang is not LLVM, duh! And yeah, Rust has its own frontend for LLVM, so why should you even have to use clang if you have LLVM and Rust installed? It's not like you're missing out on anything. I mean, unless you care about performance, compilation speed, error messages, static analysis, or any of that stuff. In that case, sure, go ahead and use your default compiler toolchain. But hey, guess what? Mozilla decided to only support clang/llvm now, so you better jump on that bandwagon unless you want to deal with a potential maintenance headache. Seriously, it's not like they went for some random, unknown compiler. They went for one that's already widely used and supported on every distro. So quit whining and just get with the program.
------
Yo, so I gotta say, your understanding of slavery in the Old Testament is straight up messed up, dude. Trying to sugarcoat it as "short-term indentured servitude" is some major BS. Yeah, sure, there were rules and stuff, but that doesn't change the fact that these people were still owned by someone else! And saying that some people voluntarily chose slavery? Seriously? Like they had any other options with zero rights and freedom? GTFO with that nonsense.

And don't even get me started on this whole "god freeing us" crap. If god really wanted to free us from all our problems, he wouldn't have let them exist in the first place. How about he just prevent us from getting into debt, or feeling shame, or getting addicted? But nah, he gotta let us suffer first and then supposedly "free" us later. Sounds like a load of BS to me.

So yeah, your whole post is just trying to justify some messed up stuff by using religious mumbo jumbo. Not buying it, bro.
------
Ugh, can we just stop comparing car brands to camera companies? It's like apples and oranges. But sure, I get what you're trying to say. Canon's cinema line is like the fancy Ferrari of cameras, while their consumer stills cameras are more like a basic Mercedes. And yeah, Canon doesn't seem to give a damn about the consumer video market. They're so focused on their stupid internal divisions and politics that it's probably gonna take a miracle for anything to change. Maybe when those old farts in charge finally retire or kick the bucket, we'll see some progress. But until then, it's just gonna be more disappointment and lackluster releases from Canon. Ugh.
------
Alright, listen up peeps! Let me break it down for you. So apparently, insurance companies and hospitals are playing this messed up game. The insurance companies want customers, right? But nobody wants to get insurance unless they actually get some real benefits out of it. So, what do these sneaky insurance jerks do? They go to the hospitals and offer them some dough if they can lower their prices for the insured folks. Sounds alright, huh?

Well, here's where it gets twisted. Those greedy hospitals couldn't lower the damn prices any further because even the money from the insurance companies wasn't cutting it. So, what do they do? Instead of doing the sensible thing and keeping prices low, they freaking raise them! Can you believe it? So now, us poor suckers with insurance end up paying pretty much the same amount as we would have without them. And on top of that, we have to shell out extra moolah for these so-called "premium" prices.

I don't know about you, but this whole system seems like a big fat scam to me. It's all about making more money for these corporate sharks, while we regular folks get the shaft. Smh.
------
Bruh, y'all need to add some info about why Europeans got that light skin. It's all about natural selection and shit. See, in them northern latitudes, the hunter-gatherer folks like the Innuits and Siberians got plenty of vitamin D in their diet so they didn't need no light skin to absorb it from the sun. But them agriculture peeps in the north, they didn't get enough of that good stuff in their food, so their bodies started using UV light to make up for it, ya know? That's why natural selection kicked in and gave 'em light-ass skin. So, if you wanna be a true expert on this topic, throw in some facts about how light skin helps with efficient vitamin D synthesis. Peace out!
------
Man, that mystery box was straight up disappointing. I mean, I only saw it in some lame YouTube videos, but I could tell the quality was trash. Thank god they didn't ship to England, because I would've wasted my hard-earned cash on some recycled shades with new packaging. Seriously, couldn't they have come up with some new shades inspired by what she actually wears on the show? Like, keep that red velvet shade, but throw in a couple of new ones to make it worth our while. The only thing that didn't totally suck was the eyeshadow palette, so at least I don't have any regrets there. But man, what a letdown overall.
------
Hey, quick question. Why are you so concerned about immigrants being of "quality"? What does that even mean? Are you saying that only certain people from certain countries are worthy of coming here? That's just plain discrimination, my friend.

And seriously, "demanding" immigrants? Who do you think you are? This entitlement is getting out of hand. People from all walks of life have the right to seek a better future, and it's not up to us to decide who gets in based on some arbitrary standards of quality.

As for your comment about incentivizing having children, what's the relevance here? Are you suggesting we should only rely on our own population growth instead of welcoming immigrants? Newsflash, pal - we need diversity and different perspectives to grow and thrive as a nation. So let's drop this elitist attitude and embrace the benefits that immigration brings.
------
Alright, listen up, folks. I've got a bone to pick with all this talk about bringing NHL teams back to Quebec, Markham, or Hamilton. Seriously, what's the point? We're just shuffling around the same old hockey fans and not actually creating anything new here. Quebec already has their beloved Canadiens and a bunch of people who were forced to support them after the Nordiques left. Adding another team in Quebec City won't magically grow the fanbase, it'll just divide it even further.

And don't get me started on Hamilton and Markham. Sure, they might be drooling over the idea of having their own team, but think about the poor Buffalo Sabres. Those guys rely on Canadian fans crossing the damn border to fill their seats. Can you imagine the blow they'll take if a team pops up in Hamilton? It'd be a disaster.

Sure, these new Canadian teams might make some decent cash initially, but in the long run, we're just saturating the market. And that's gonna lead to the devaluation of all the franchises in the area. So let's think bigger, people, and come up with some better solutions for the league.
------
Man, Ohio cops are the worst! My dad used to always talk shit about them too. He said they were brutal back in the day, especially towards out-of-state truckers. And it seems like nothing has changed! My dad just drove through Ohio and he said it was a damn nightmare. Cops everywhere, pulling people over left and right. It's like a freaking gauntlet! And they're so strict about speed limits too, it's ridiculous. Now every time I drive in other cities, I feel like I'm driving like a grandma because I'm so used to Ohio cops lurking around every corner. It's messed up, man. Anyone else had a similar experience with these power-hungry Ohio cops?
------
Damn, I can't believe people still think this music is relevant. It's like they're stuck in the past. Who gives a crap about "epic and awe-inspiring" themes? We've moved on, dude. Get with the times. And seriously, quantity over quality? Are you kidding me? There's so much garbage out there now, it's hard to find anything worth listening to. I miss when music actually had emotion and insight, not like the mindless crap we have now. This isn't a musical era, it's a frickin' dumpster fire. So yeah, go ahead and keep worshiping your outdated tunes, but the rest of us have moved on to better things.
------
I gotta say, I find Dimir and Orzhov a bit weird, man. Like, these two guilds are all about control, right? So how the hell are they gonna work together? It just doesn't make sense to me. I could totally see Dimir teaming up with Gruul or Golgari, you know? 'Cause they're easier to control, and maybe even Azorius 'cause Dimir could use their corruption against them.

And speaking of Azorius, they could totally mesh well with Selesnya 'cause they're all about following the law, and Orzhov too. But let's not forget, Boros is the perfect match for those rule-loving Azorius folks. They might have a tough time pairing up with anyone else though (maybe Selesnya 'cause they need some healers).

Gruul could probably get along with Golgari 'cause they both dig nature, and Golgari is already kinda dead anyway, so it's a good fit for the wild Gruul peeps.

But damn, Izzet and Simic, now that's a match made in heaven! Although, I wouldn't be surprised if they tried teaming up with other guilds for some experiment or whatever.

Selesnya and Golgari, man, I just don't like 'em. I mean, sure, they could team up and have Selesnya brainwash some zombies or some shit, but at the core, Selesnya values nature while Golgari's all about death. It's like they clash, you know? And don't even get me started on Gruul and Rakdos. They'd kill each other before anything else, even though it kinda fits the chaotic vibe. But hey, we did see Rakdos using Gruul to take down Selesnya, so who knows?
------
Seriously, are you just here to spew out conspiracy theory garbage or what? I mean, can you even back up any of these claims with actual evidence? It's funny how you conveniently ignore the fact that Sarah Jeong was actually responding to racist trolls when she made those tweets. And guess what? She apologized for them too. But nah, let's just keep twisting the truth to fit your narrative.

And yeah, Spike Lee made a mistake with that tweet, but he owned up to it and took responsibility. Can't say the same for certain other people who constantly spread lies and misinformation without ever admitting fault.

And don't even get me started on Alex Jones. That guy is a whole different level of crazy. It's not about his politics, it's about the toxic and harmful content he spreads. But of course, you're gonna cry foul and claim it's some grand conspiracy against conservatives. Give me a break.

Honestly, if you're just here to push your agenda and spout nonsense, maybe you should find another subreddit where people actually buy into that crap.
------
Man, it's so frustrating to see all these developers out there who have no clue about how to use the CPU cache effectively. Like seriously, do they even know what they're doing? By the time they realize they need to optimize their software, all they can do is some half-assed "hot spot" optimizations. 

I mean, come on! Even if you're just an OOP developer, it's not rocket science to understand that keeping your objects smaller than the cache and ensuring good data locality can make a huge difference in performance. It also makes your code easier to understand and gives you the flexibility to optimize it later if necessary. 

So next time you're coding and think you're hot stuff, take a step back and actually educate yourself on how to utilize that CPU cache. Trust me, it'll save you a lot of headaches in the long run.
------
Yo, did anyone manage to dodge those damn spoilers? I mean, I kinda did and kinda didn't. Stupid Imgur had this hilarious yet pervy bnha webcomic about Toga's quirk on the frontpage like a freakin' month ago. I swear I tried searching for it just now, but after like 15 frickin' minutes of scrolling, I couldn't find it anywhere. 

**Update:** Finally, I found that damn comic! [Here it is!](<url>)

Anyway, even with that dumb comic, it still wasn't like super obvious when Toga transformed during the test. I just assumed she and Camie had similar quirks, like Kirashima and Tetsutetsu, you know? So this reveal was still pretty mind-blowing for me, kinda like a "oh, duh!" moment instead of a "holy shit!" one.

Damn, that really sucks about your fur baby. Losing a pet is always tough, especially after so many years together. Cancer can just go straight to hell, seriously. It's heartbreaking to see them in pain and not being able to do anything about it. And I totally feel you on the mascara thing, crying messes that shit up real quick.

It's rough watching your other cat search for their buddy. Animals mourn too, it's sad as hell. And now she's stuck on a diet, poor thing. Losing her food must be like a double whammy. It's hard to think about getting another cat, knowing that you'll have to go through this all over again. But hey, maybe she'll outlive us all with her asshole behavior, who knows?

Hang in there, friend. Losing a furry family member is never easy, but we're here for you.

Honestly, I don't get why you're getting all these downvotes. Like, seriously, what's the big deal about questioning the legitimacy of that stupid referendum? It was just an advisory one anyway, and let's not forget how shady everything was. Dodgy money, lies from those so-called "prominent" campaigners on the winning side, and let's not even start with the interference from a hostile past government. And what's with their weird obsession with cathedrals? So messed up.

I mean, come on, it's not unreasonable to think about having a second referendum. You know, just to see if people still want to jump off that economic cliff now that we actually have more information. It's called being responsible and informed, people! But hey, let's not go too far with our thinking, right? We wouldn't want to upset the snowflakes who act like this whole mess is some kind of divine decision. So yeah, keep fighting the good fight and ignore the haters, my friend.

Yo, dude, that's some messed up shit right there. I mean, seriously, who the hell destroys an expensive-ass dirt bike just to make a point? I get that the kid got suspended and all, but damn, his dad needs to chill the fuck out. There are so many other ways to discipline your kid without going full Hulk mode on a frickin' bike. Like, why not just ground him or take away his phone or something? That would've been more reasonable, y'know? And making him watch as his dream bike gets annihilated? That's just cruel, man. I don't care what anyone says, that punishment is way too extreme and downright fucked up. Poor kid must've been traumatized for life after that shit. Smh.
------
Honestly, this whole situation is a complete mess. The fact that these kids are being separated from their parents is just plain messed up. It's obvious that the system in place is a joke if it's so difficult to reunite them. Like, come on, how hard is it to keep track of where these kids are and where their parents are? It's not rocket science.

And now we're expecting these parents to somehow find their way back into the US to get their kids? Yeah, good luck with that. The legal process is probably too slow or complicated, so they're gonna have to risk crossing the border illegally again just to have a chance at finding their children. This is ridiculous.

But my biggest worry is what's gonna happen to these poor kids in the long run. Growing up in a foreign country, separated from your family, living in some crappy tent city - that's gonna mess these kids up. I mean, imagine the trauma they're going through. And what happens when they become adults? We might see a rise in crime, violence, and all that bad stuff. It's just gonna be a never-ending cycle.

Overall, this whole situation is a complete disaster and it's pretty damn worrying. I really hope something changes soon because this is not the kind of country I want to live in.

Seriously, how clueless can you be? Instead of wasting your time asking dumb questions on here, maybe you should try doing some actual research. It's clear that you have zero knowledge about the topic you're blabbering on about. Hate speech isn't just some random crap you make up in your head. It's defined by the law, you know, that thing called legal documents and precedent? But I guess reading is too much effort for you.

Let me spell it out for you since you clearly struggle with basic comprehension. Hate speech includes calling for violence against certain groups or spreading false information that leads to harm. Like this nutjob Alex Jones defaming Hillary Clinton and spreading conspiracy theories about sex rings and pizza places. And surprise, surprise, some idiot actually believed that crap and fired a rifle at the place! So yeah, hate speech has real-life consequences, in case you didn't get the memo.

If you want more examples, do yourself a favor and google it. I'm not your personal search engine, lazyass. Just try not to embarrass yourself anymore with your ignorance.

Dude, seriously? You're really gonna freak out over a simple question like where to go for dinner? And then you go posting about it all over Reddit like it's some huge crisis. Chill out, man. It's not that deep. Just tell your girl you don't know yet and move on. No need to overcomplicate things and make her think you hate her or something. 

And what's up with this whole obsession of yours? You've been posting the same damn thing in multiple subreddits, like we're all supposed to care or something. Newsflash: we don't. You're just coming off as overly paranoid and needy. If I were the guy you're talking about, I'd run for the hills after seeing all this drama. Give it a rest, dude.
------
Dude, are you seriously buying into this crap? I mean, come on! Feinstein pulls this last-minute BS and expects us to believe it? And let's not forget about the lack of corroboration and the fact that this supposedly happened like a million years ago. It's obvious this is just a desperate attempt to smear someone because they don't agree with their politics. And now we have this second person popping up with her own credibility issues? Give me a break! Look, I'm not a Trump supporter or anything, but this is just low. Destroying someone's entire life just because you can't handle their political stance? That's messed up, man. Can we please focus on real issues instead of this political circus? Unbelievable.
------
Wow, seriously? Are you actually asking this question? It's mind-boggling how clueless some people can be. First of all, let's get one thing straight - women are not objects or receptacles for men's pleasure. They are human beings with their own desires and needs in the bedroom. It's absolutely ridiculous to assume that just because a guy can ejaculate, the sex is automatically good. Pleasure and satisfaction should be a two-way street, my friend.

And let's talk about your generalization that all women hate sex, except for the ones you apparently sleep with. That is such a warped and ignorant perspective. Newsflash: women enjoy sex just as much as men do. Maybe if you took the time to actually communicate and understand your partner's needs, instead of expecting them to magically orgasm from your lackluster efforts, you might have a different experience. Just saying.

Yo, listen up fellow Redditors! I gotta warn you about a major portal screw-up that some of y'all seem to be making. When you're moving those freaking portals around, you better make damn sure they're on the same freaking coordinates. Otherwise, you're gonna end up with either a new portal popping up close to the original one, or worse, getting teleported to some random portal that's way the hell off.

Now pay attention, because I'm about to drop some knowledge bombs on your sorry asses. To link those godforsaken portals correctly, you gotta take the exact x and z coordinates of the portal in the overworld and divide 'em by 8. Got it? So if your overworld portal has coordinates like x = -880 and z = 1600, then in the nether, you better make those coords x = -110 and z = 200.

So next time you wanna mess around with portals, don't be a total noob and remember what I just told you. Don't say I didn't warn ya when you end up lost in the Minecraft universe. Peace out!

I totally get what you're saying, man. And let me tell you, there's a bunch of reasons why there ain't as many up-and-coming pros in Korea compared to the foreign scene. First off, the whole Code A situation is messed up. You gotta grind your way through that shit just to make some cash, and even then, you might get screwed over by some tough group and lose out on a fat paycheck for the year.

Secondly, brood war is still big in Korea, and it's got more appeal to the younger crowd. So these Korean kids are either splitting their time between brood war and SC2, or they say "screw it" and stick to playing brood war exclusively. That means they never really get good enough at SC2 or don't bother playing it at all. I can't prove this, but it makes sense to me because the foreign brood war scene is so small and seems to have an older player base.

And finally, the cost of living is way higher in Korea compared to other countries where these foreign pros come from. Like, have you seen the prices over there? It's insane! So these foreign players can sustain themselves much easier when they're starting out and can put more time into practicing and getting better.

But honestly, I don't think it's all bad. Having regular contenders from different scenes in the later rounds of Code S keeps things fresh, ya know? Plus, you get some crazy upsets and surprise runs from the foreigners, and that keeps the whole tournament exciting until the round of 8 or 4. So, it's not necessarily a bad thing 'cause it means the best players are getting through to the end.

Hey guys, check out this sick ravine seed I found! I know y'all love them ravines, so I thought I'd share. The seed is "<phone>" (creative, I know). 

Okay, so picture this: you spawn on a freakin' hill. Look to your left and you'll spot a village church temple, but wait for it... it's a zombie village! How cool is that? But hold up, that's not even the best part. On your way down the hill towards the village, you'll come across a badass ravine with a freaking exposed stronghold at the bottom! Mind. Blown.

Now, let's talk about the desert situation. There are not one, but TWO villages in that bad boy. And if that's not enough, right smack dab in the middle of a freakin' river, you'll find a friggin' temple. How insane is that?

Oh, and don't forget the swamp behind you when you spawn. It's got a wicked witch's hut and MORE ravines. I mean, what more could you ask for?

Oh, wait. I almost forgot something. So, when I tried to heal those zombie villagers in the village, they turned out to be useless pieces of crap. Couldn't open the trade menu with any of 'em. Maybe it's just a glitch on my end, but I thought I'd give you a heads up.

Alright, have a blast exploring this epic seed, fam! Enjoy the ravines and all the other mind-blowing stuff. Let me know if any of you have better luck with those useless zombie villagers. Peace out!

First of all, whoa! Hold up! What the heck is this quote about? It's from some book called tafsir al-jalalayn on 9:29. So apparently, it's saying we should fight people who don't believe in God or the last day? Are you kidding me? That's just plain messed up! And it goes on to say that these people should pay some kind of tax to Islam and be submissive? Seriously? This is some next-level intolerance right here.

I mean, who the hell wrote this stuff? And who actually follows it? It's mind-boggling how people can justify violence and oppression in the name of religion. It's like they've completely missed the whole point of being a decent human being.

I don't know about you guys, but I'm just here for some casual Reddit browsing, not for reading this outrageous nonsense. Can we please keep this subreddit a little more sane?
------
Man, I've gotta vent about this autocorrect madness on iOS. Seriously, what's the deal with it always changing "come" to "coke"? It's like the freakin' autocorrect has some secret obsession with soda or something. Like, I hardly ever talk about coke, but whenever I wanna say "come" it's all like, "Nope, let's make that a nice cold cola instead!" It's so aggravating that I had to set up a keyboard shortcut just to fix this nonsense. And it's not even just casual conversations, it's like it actively tries to embarrass me by swapping out harmless "come" for "coke" in inappropriate situations. Like, seriously, iOS, get your act together! Autocorrect is usually pretty on point, but why does it have this bizarre obsession with these two words? I bet there are tons of others out there dealing with the same friggin' annoyance.
------
Yo, listen up, fellow Redditors! I've been doin' some research on these sneaky-ass legal cases, and let me tell ya, there's a secret sauce to winnin' big bucks. You gotta find a bunch of lazy idiots who can't even afford a lawyer, and then you throw in a couple of winners who already made fat stacks. That way, you can show the broke losers what they could potentially win and keep 'em interested enough to stick around.

But hold up, it ain't over yet. Once you got your dream team of plaintiffs, it's a freakin' battle royale with other money-hungry lawyers. Picture this: a bunch of poor schmucks workin' at a paper company gettin' exposed to some toxic crap. Three half-dead folks take that shit to court and come out victorious. Now, three different groups start recruitin' past and present workers for a lawsuit. But the court ain't havin' none of that shit. They wanna save some cash, so they say, "Hey, let's merge all them cases into one."

As a lawyer, you don't wanna bank on findin' those one-in-a-million cases, man. 'Cause you might spend a whole damn year buildin' a solid case, just to have it snatched away 'cause you got one less plaintiff than the other guy. Or worse, these people might chicken out 'cause they can't handle the damn publicity. So, think twice before investin' all your time and effort, my dudes.
------
Damn, I have a story that tops that one. So, picture this: I'm at this party, right? It's filled with a bunch of pretentious assholes who think they're better than everyone else. But whatever, I'm just there for the free booze. So I start knocking back shots like there's no tomorrow.

Anyways, nature calls and I stumble my way to the bathroom. I whip it out, thinking it's gonna be a quick and easy pee. But nope, my drunk ass completely misses the mark. I end up pissing all over myself, creating a nice little piss stain on my pants. And let me tell you, it wasn't a cute little dribble, it was a full-blown Niagara Falls situation.

Now here's where shit gets interesting. Instead of admitting defeat and dealing with my embarrassment like a normal person, I decide to pull a fucking Houdini. I grab the nearest expensive-looking object, which happened to be a fancy-ass vase, and smash it on the damn floor. I stumble out of the bathroom, bleeding from the broken glass, and start ranting about how the vase attacked me.

Everyone's too wasted to even question what the hell is going on, so they buy my story and start spreading it like wildfire. I became the legend who fought a vase and lived to tell the tale. Little do they know, I was just covering up my drunken piss mishap. So, yeah, that's how I saved face and became a party hero.
------
Okay, so here's my take on this. I mean, come on people! This dude is talking about raising awareness, but he's barely even in the spotlight! How the hell is anyone gonna know about this movement if he's not out there making a fuss?

Sure, his charity work sounds great and all, helping black folks with jobs and education. But seriously, can't he do more? He's supposed to be the freakin' face of this thing! Get all the players together, man, and give a kick-ass speech that'll make everyone remember why they're kneeling in the first place.

I don't know about you, but it feels like the whole country has moved on from this issue. We need to bring it back to the forefront and shake things up. Let's not waste any more time and let our politicians just screw it all up. It's time for action, before this whole damn thing fades away and we're left with nothing.

Sorry for the rant, but I just had to let it out. Let's make a difference, dammit!

Yo, not gonna lie, I ain't u/mcduffbsmith, but I got a sick technique for hoppin' fences. Here's how I do it, man.

First things first, you gotta grip that top bar of the fence with your dominant hand palm down, and do the same with your other hand. Firm grip, bro.

Then, squat down like you're about to take a dump and jump at the same time. But don't go too high, just enough to get your dominant foot on the bar. Your other foot can chill on the chain link, bein' all balanced and stuff.

Now comes the fun part. Most of your body is already over the damn fence. Just gently bring your non-dominant foot onto the bar, while movin' your dominant foot to the other side of the chain link for balance. Easy peasy, bro.

Now you got options here. You can either climb down all classy-like, using your limbs to gracefully descend. Or, if you're feelin' all crazy, you can push yourself off the fence, makin' sure your trailing foot doesn't get caught. But hey, only go for that if you've hopped fences before, my dude.

Hope that helps, fellow fence-hopper! Stay sneaky and keep conquerin' those barriers like a boss. Peace out!
------
Look, I gotta say, this whole situation is a fucking joke. Like seriously, how can anyone expect the OP to just let go of their anger and move on when they're being treated like shit? It's not like they're asking for the world here, just some basic respect and understanding. And you, with your holier-than-thou attitude, thinking you're so damn perfect. Newsflash buddy, life isn't all rainbows and sunshine for everyone. Maybe take a moment to step outside your bubble and try to see things from someone else's perspective. The way you're talking down to everyone is just plain disgusting. If you've got something to say, why not have the balls to say it to their face instead of hiding behind a computer screen? Or better yet, keep your toxic nonsense to yourself. No one needs that kind of negativity around here.
------
Alrighty, here's the dealio. So, like, you know about the whole planck length thing, right? Well, turns out it ain't actually the smallest unit of distance. It's just this unit that pops up when you take a bunch of universal constants and do some funky ratio stuff.

Like, seriously, no matter what system of measures you use, physics has these universal constants that stay the same. Whether you're all about metric units or you're stuck in the imperial system (ugh, who even still uses that?), you'll end up with the same values for stuff like the speed of light, vacuum stuff, and planck's constant. It's like they're chillin' together on a cosmic level.

So, when you take these constants and divide 'em in a way that gives you units of speed, boom, you got yourself the planck length. It's not some magical tiny thing, it's just a quirk of the universe. So next time someone gets all worked up about the planck length, just hit 'em with this knowledge. Peace out!
------
Are you serious? That code is a hot mess. I mean, come on, who the heck writes code like that? It's like they're intentionally trying to make it as confusing as possible. I don't want to spend hours deciphering someone else's illegible code just to figure out what the heck they were trying to do.

And don't even get me started on the bugs. If there's an issue in that line they pointed out, good luck finding it! It's like searching for a needle in a haystack. I'm telling you, it's just not worth the headache.

I don't understand why some people think that writing code that looks like a bunch of hieroglyphics is impressive. It's not. It's just plain dumb. We should be striving for simplicity and clarity, not convoluted messes that only a genius can unravel.

So no, I definitely don't believe most people would find his code easier to read. Only those masochists who enjoy torturing themselves with mind-bending puzzles would appreciate it. The rest of us just want code that we can understand without needing a decoder ring.
------
Man, I gotta vent about this crazy relationship I had with this DJ dude. He literally looked like Jon Snow and rode a badass motorcycle. And let me tell you, the passion between us was off the charts. Like, more love than I've ever experienced in my life. But here's the kicker - I have a daughter who needed a father figure, and I wanted that for her too. But this guy didn't want any of that commitment crap. Can you believe it?

It sucks, man. I miss him like crazy and can't help but wonder what he's up to these days. He made me feel so damn alive. It's been a year and a half, and I still daydream about what could have been. But deep down, I know we weren't meant to be. Guess I'll just keep on scrolling through Reddit, hoping for some distractions from my love life drama.
------
Ugh, seriously Apple, do you even listen to your customers? It's like they live in their own little bubble and don't give a damn about what we actually want. I mean, who the hell asked for these ridiculously oversized phones that you can't even use with one hand? The SE is a joke, way too tiny, but making the screen edge to edge and just slightly increasing the overall size would be perfect for us normal folks with average-sized hands. 

I don't get why they think everyone wants these massive screens for watching movies. Like, sure, some people do, but that's not the majority. Can't they see that there's a market for a compact phone that's actually functional without needing two hands or a purse to carry it around? Ugh, it's so frustrating. Apple needs a reality check and start listening to what their customers actually want instead of shoving these oversized monstrosities down our throats.
------
The upgrade is legit never bad, man. Like seriously, if you got it, you're golden. Just think about it, even if you save just one damn dt with it, you're already making bank. And let me tell you, sustained dt harass could be a total game-changer if you can get that upgrade faster.

But honestly, a quicker blink cooldown ain't gonna do squat for this unit offensively. They already pack a punch, man. It's like boom, blink in and bam, annihilation mode engaged. Or if the enemy survives, they'll just detect those sneaky dts and blast 'em to oblivion. So basically, the only real advantage of a cooldown change is getting the hell outta trouble more often. And let me tell ya, this unit is freakin' annoying enough already. We don't need them having a get out of jail free card every freakin' 10 seconds. Like, come on, give us a break!
------
Hey there, fellow Redditors! So, I've been doing some reading on the whole vegetarian and vegan lifestyle, and I gotta say, I'm a bit skeptical. Like seriously, why do all these studies claiming that vegetarians live longer conveniently leave out the mention of toxins? I mean, come on! We all know that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic amines are some serious sh*t, right? And yet, they just brush it off like it's no big deal.

I'm starting to think that maybe it's not these so-called "toxins" that are the problem here. Maybe it's just that vegetarians stuff their faces with tons of nutrients and antioxidants, thanks to all that fiber and vitamin C. Plus, let's not forget that they're probably skinnier due to their lower caloric intake, which means less obesity. So, it's probably just those factors that are making them live longer, not some mumbo jumbo about heat-generated compounds.

But hey, that's just my two cents. Feel free to prove me wrong or jump on the bandwagon. Let's have a lively discussion, shall we?
------
Lol, people really need to educate themselves before bashing diesel engines. Yeah, sure, they used to be dirtier than gasoline, but times have changed, my friend. These modern diesels got these fancy aftertreatment systems that reduce all them nasty gases like NOx. So yeah, they might be a tad more expensive, but guess what? They're actually cleaner than those gasoline engines!

And don't even get me started on particulates. Diesel used to have a bad rep for spewing out those little cancer-causing particles, but now they got filters installed in modern diesels. So in your face, gasoline fanboys! Oh, and by the way, gasoline is gonna get those filters too, so don't act all high and mighty.

And let's talk about smog, shall we? Sulphurous gases are the real culprits behind smogs, and both diesel and gasoline have pretty much eliminated those suckers. Ultra-low sulfur diesel came later, so stop spreading this misconception that modern diesels are still causing smog!

Oh, and FYI, it's not just cars that contribute to pollution. Trains and shipping in coastal cities are also doing their part. So maybe focus on the bigger picture instead of hating on diesel all the damn time!
------
Alright, seriously people, can we talk about this whole "world building" thing? I mean, it's not rocket science. When you mention a freaking war hammer or a sword, we expect it to mean the same damn thing it means in our world. You know, those big-ass, heavy weapons that knights used to bash each other's brains out? So don't come at me with this vague crap like "particularly heavy" and expect me to just fill in the blanks.

And while we're at it, let's talk about context. If you don't explicitly say something is magical or different, we're gonna assume it's like what we had in medieval times. It's called common sense, people! Don't give me that "oh, it's a fantasy world, so anything goes" nonsense. George R.R. Martin grounds this stuff in reality, believe it or not. Yeah, sure, the castles might be a tad fancier and the ships a bit larger, but they're not flying through the freaking sky shooting laser beams.

So, if it says "Robert had a big war hammer," then guess what? He had a pretty damn big war hammer, not some ridiculous, over-the-top monstrosity. Come on, use your heads, people! This realism is what makes these books so damn good. GRRM ain't playing around with our expectations. So let's stop overcomplicating things and stick to what actually makes sense in this world. End of rant.
------
Okay, first of all, I totally get why you're mad about this kitten situation. It's not cool for them to just dump an innocent animal on your doorstep without even asking if you wanted it. That's not how you show responsibility, it's just a total lack of respect.

And then they have the nerve to say you overreacted? Ugh, classic move of people who don't want to take responsibility for their own actions. It's not like you didn't already have enough pets to take care of. They should've thought about that before bringing the kitten over.

Honestly, I think you made the right call by rehoming the poor thing. You shouldn't have to deal with their mess. And what's this nonsense about a pet fee? If they wanted their precious grandchild to have a pet, they should've taken care of it themselves.

You're definitely not the asshole here. They are. And if they can't see that, then they need to take a good look in the mirror. Keep doing what you're doing, and don't let them guilt trip you into feeling bad. You did the right thing.
------
Yo, what the hell is up with these lying MPs these days? Seriously, it's like they don't even give a crap anymore. It's always been a bit dodgy, but now they're just shameless. And who the fuck holds them accountable? The media? Ha, don't make me laugh.

I blame the AV referendum. That's when shit really hit the fan. The "no" campaign was full of lies and fearmongering. And they got away with it! So, of course, that opened the floodgates for Brexit and all that bullshit. And what happens to these liars? They get promoted! Johnson becomes foreign secretary? Are you kidding me?

And don't even get me started on those so-called "groups" like the "taxpayers alliance" and "economists for free trade." They get all this damn coverage, spreading their biased nonsense. And where's the BBC in all of this? They used to be respectable, but now they're just a platform for these arseholes.

But you know what really grinds my gears? The whole electoral system. FPTP, safe seats, and parachuting candidates. MPs think they can do whatever the fuck they want, as long as they kiss enough arses in their party. Look at Esther McVey, rejected by her own constituents, and then magically dropped into a safe seat. It's a bloody joke.

Sorry for the rant, mate. It's just hard not to get pissed off about all this.
------
Wow, what a load of crap. Are you seriously trying to tell me that private universities are affordable? Yeah right. I don't know what kind of fantasy world you're living in, but us normal folks can't just magically get access to all these endowments and scholarships. And don't even get me started on public universities. They're practically robbing us blind with their skyrocketing tuition fees. Thanks a lot, tax cuts! It's like they want us to drown in student loans for the rest of our lives. So really, spare me with your "reasonably good students" nonsense. The reality is that higher education is a money-making machine, and we're all just pawns in their game.
------
Yo, I totally feel you on this one. I was all pumped to dive into the Stormlight Archives hype train, but man, it lost me real quick. Like seriously, I got about 20% through the first book and my interest just went poof. This thing is heavier than a sumo wrestler and it's dragging me down.

And let's talk about this supposed epic worldbuilding. Yeah, it's big, but damn, it feels like we're stuck in this little bubble of characters' perspectives. I've read a thousand frickin' pages and I still have no clue what's happening outside of the few characters we follow. Sure, there are those lame interludes, but they're like tiny appetizers that leave you hangry.

The world within the characters' reach seems cool, I'll give it that, but the rest of it? It might as well be made of cardboard cutouts. I'm getting bored with these puny glimpses of the world, man. Can someone please hand me a road map or something?
------
Man, it's ridiculous how these filthy rich people just keep hoarding their mountains of cash. I mean, seriously, who needs hundreds of billions of dollars? It's like they're swimming Scrooge McDuck style in a vault full of gold coins or something. I get that they worked hard and all, but come on, spread the damn wealth. I'm not saying they should give it all away, but at least spend it! Buy a freaking island or something. Think about the economic boost that would create! I don't know where they stash all this dough, probably in some fancy offshore accounts or under their fancy mattresses, but it's just plain outrageous. It's time these greedy monsters start giving back and stop being so damn selfish. End rant.
------
Honestly, I'm so tired of all this political drama. Can we just move on already? The whole impeachment thing is a joke. I mean, come on, where's the solid evidence? It's all just a bunch of speculation and hearsay. We're wasting so much time and energy on this nonsense when there are real issues we should be focusing on. I get it, people don't like the guy, but that doesn't mean we should jump to impeaching him without concrete proof. It's a dangerous precedent to set. And let's not forget, politicians lie all the time. Who's to say they're not just playing dirty political games here? I'll believe it when I see some real hard evidence, but until then, count me out.
------
Uh, okay, let me just say this straight up - Solo: A Star Wars Story was a pointless movie, plain and simple. It didn't add any value to the franchise and was just a waste of time and money. I mean, who cares how Han and Chewie met? It doesn't give us any new insights into their relationship. And finding out that there's some weird sentient being trapped inside the Millennium Falcon? Seriously, that just ruins the whole legacy of the ship. Plus, learning that Han has always been a good guy? That's just a load of crap. It completely undermines his character development in the original trilogy. And don't even get me started on Lando. All we learn about him is that he screwed a droid and loves wearing capes. Wow, groundbreaking stuff right there. Honestly, taking Solo out of the canon wouldn't change a damn thing because it's irrelevant and unimportant to the series it's supposed to be a part of. So yeah, total waste of time, folks.

Okay, so here's my two cents on this whole argon window situation. Like, seriously, who even cares about the seal on an argon window? I mean, come on, it's just a freaking window. But hey, if you're gonna get all technical and scientific about it, let's entertain this idea for a second.

So yeah, if the seal on an argon window breaks, I guess it could start exchanging with regular atmospheric air. No surprise there, right? And if the window was at a lower pressure, it could totally suck in all that humid crap from outside and condense on the inside. Gross.

But here's my genius idea: why not use dry air instead? You know, like they do at the factory with one of those fancy dryers. Maybe if that seal broke, it wouldn't exchange like argon. I mean, air is air, right? Maybe it could actually hold up better in the long run.

But hey, what do I know? I'm just a random dude/dudette on the internet. We need someone in the trade who actually knows their stuff to spill the beans on the warranty data. So if you're out there, Mr./Ms. Window Expert, hit us up and share your wisdom!

Honestly, I don't get why people are so worked up about Kanye's newer songs. Like, yeah, they're not the same as his old stuff, but does he really need to keep making the same type of music forever? People need to chill and let artists evolve, man. It's like they can't handle any change or growth in their favorite artists. And seriously, it's not like every single song has to be some deep, thought-provoking masterpiece. Sometimes it's just fun to have some silly, lighthearted tracks. So what if Kanye wants to make a joke song or two? It doesn't mean he's lost his talent or anything. People need to stop living in the past and just enjoy the music for what it is.

Man, for whom the bell tolls? I had high hopes for this book, but damn, it just didn't do it for me. The writing and dialogue were supposedly fantastic, but I couldn't even make it to the halfway point. I don't know if I'll ever give it another shot, to be honest.

And speaking of giving up, Salem's Lot by Stephen King was another book that left me hanging. I'm a huge SK fan, like no one else in my crew can match my love for his stuff. But that one? Nope, couldn't get into it at all.

Oh, and don't even get me started on The Poisonwood Bible. What the hell happened there? Suddenly, the story took a nosedive and stopped making any sense to me. Not my cup of tea, that's for sure.

But hey, life's too short to waste on books that aren't doing it for us, right? I've got a frickin' mile-long list of books I'm dying to read, so I'm moving on. On to better literary adventures!
------
Honestly, I don't get why people are freaking out about gun control. I mean, yeah, I grew up around guns and even served in the army as a rifleman, but come on! It's not like taking away some of these crazy weapons is gonna ruin our lives. Plus, I lean more towards the left and believe in gun control, so this all seems pretty reasonable to me.

The only thing I'm a bit iffy about is giving parliament the power to change classifications. Like really? Do we really trust those politicians to make sensible decisions about this stuff? I think the RCMP might actually be better at it. But hey, they do have a proposal to classify based on function instead, so that could solve that issue.

Look, I might not agree with Bernier on a lot of things, but honestly, there's nothing here that really gets my panties in a twist. Can we all just calm down and have a civil discussion for once? Geez.
------
Alright, listen up, folks. I don't know what you're on about with all this philosophical mumbo jumbo, but let me tell ya, this whole Euthyphro's dilemma thing is a load of crap. Who cares about that? We need to focus on designing a better world, not debating some ancient Greek dude. And I've got the perfect solution: a superpowerful AI. Yeah, you heard me right. This bad boy can solve all our problems for us. No need for gods or any of that nonsense.

Now, before you start spouting off about how humans can't become gods and blah blah blah, let me lay it out for you. A child grows up, right? But us measly humans don't suddenly become gods. So that analogy is useless. And don't even get me started on this whole blind faith crap. Are you seriously telling me we should just accept whatever this god wants without question? That's ridiculous!

And here's another thing. If this so-called god says something is good, does that automatically make it good? No way! That's just a recipe for a tyrant ruling over us all. I mean, come on, people! Use your brains and stop blindly following this god's every whim. We can create our own better world without relying on some imaginary being.
------
Look, I get that you want to defend the boyfriend and all, but seriously? Giving an ultimatum is manipulative as hell. It's not like she's making some outrageous demand here. It's her freaking body and her choice. If he can't handle it, then maybe he shouldn't be in a relationship with someone who has different beliefs or wants. And what's with this "afraid our relationship won't make it" crap? If he truly loved and respected her, he would support her no matter what. It's not rocket science. And don't even get me started on "give him a few days to get over his initial reaction." Are you kidding me? This is a time-sensitive situation. She shouldn't have to wait around for him to get his act together. So, yeah, sorry for not buying into your boyfriend apologism. It's just ridiculous.
------
Wow, these religious con artists really know how to squeeze every last penny out of their gullible followers, don't they? I mean, who comes up with these random numbers like 58 or a whopping 1000? It's like they just pluck them out of thin air and expect people to blindly hand over their hard-earned cash. And don't even get me started on the Bible and its so-called "70-times-seven" rule. I mean, seriously, can we trust anything written in that ancient book? It's full of contradictions and absurdities. But hey, who needs logic and reason when you can just guilt-trip people into giving you their money, right? These greedy charlatans are nothing more than vultures preying on the vulnerable and desperate. It's sickening.
------
Lol, nice try with all that fancy science talk. But let me break it down for you in simpler terms. Basically, our eyes can only see certain colors because of the energy levels of the photons that hit them. So, when photons with too much energy (like UV light) come at us, they can actually mess things up and break down molecules. On the other hand, photons with lower energy (beyond infrared) are just too weak to get our photosensitive cells excited. So basically, it's all about finding that sweet spot of photon energy that our eyes can handle. Hope that clears things up for you! 😎

Honestly, I'm not a lawyer or anything, but like, here's my two cents. So, I think with this whole raw fish situation, it's gonna depend on where you live and stuff. Each state has its own fancy laws about food safety and stuff. So, if this happened to you, I guess you should try contacting your local health authority or find yourself a lawyer who knows all about this food liability stuff.

But let's be real, raw fish is probably sold with some kind of waiver, right? Even if it says "sushi grade," who really knows what that means? But like, the effectiveness of the waiver is up in the air, you know?

In my totally unprofessional opinion, it's gonna come down to whether the store was just being kinda lazy with hygiene or if they actually had legit reasons to believe the fish could be dangerous. If it's the first one, tough luck, my friend, 'cause we all know there's a risk with raw fish. But if they were being sloppy and had dirty work areas or customers complaining or something, then maybe you've got a case.

But hey, what do I know? This stuff ain't gonna be simple. You need a lawyer who's an expert in this crazy field to sort you out. Good luck, dude!
------
Man, this carbon border tax thing is a total mess. Like seriously, who even thought this was a good idea? Trying to account for all the damn carbon in a product coming from China? Good luck with that, my friend. They probably don't even have the data we need, and even if they did, you know they'd just lie about it anyway. 

I mean, why can't we just tax the damn carbon at the source? We already know how much of that stuff is in a barrel of oil or a tcf of natural gas. It's not rocket science. 

Instead of sitting around with our thumbs up our asses, let's actually measure the carbon output for each and every product and service and slap a tax on them accordingly. And hey, if we need to fine-tune it later as we gather more information, then so be it. But let's not pretend that the problem here is anything other than politics. Those politicians are always screwing things up, am I right?
------
This is so effing messed up! Like seriously, who are we kidding here? It's all just a big fat charade. The whole "trial" thing is just for show, a freakin' formality. We all know they want this dude dead. No doubt about it. It's like, come on, they went in to "capture" him knowing full well it's a guaranteed death sentence. Obama played his cards right, didn't he? Pretending to support the rebels, but deep down, he knew what the endgame was. He wanted Ghaddafi to bite the dust, no questions asked. Talk about some shady sh*t. I mean, dictators are all scumbags, but this is a whole new level of messed up. Just another day in the world of politics, I guess. SMH.
------
The thing that really grinds my gears about Santa Monica Airport is the arrogance of these homeowners who think their property values are more important than the rest of us. They're whining about their precious houses not being worth a whopping 5 million dollars instead of a measly 3 million. Boo freaking hoo! But that's not even the worst part. They actually believe that the airport will turn into some kind of glorious park. Yeah, right! In reality, it'll just be another ugly condo complex courtesy of those greedy developers, with maybe a small patch of grass here and there to call it a "park". And you bet your ass this is gonna make the already awful traffic on Centinela and Ocean Park even worse. It's just gonna be another Playa Vista disaster. And you know why? Because Santa Monica doesn't give a flying f*ck. They're just gonna sit back and collect their fat property tax checks while LA city gets stuck dealing with all the infrastructure headaches. Ugh, it makes me sick!
------
Listen here, you gullible idiots. I can't believe you're all falling for this bullshit. Are you really that naive? This whole thing reeks of a desperate attempt to slander a man who's just trying to do his job. Wake the fuck up already! Can't you see the obvious timing of these accusations? It's like a well-orchestrated conspiracy to bring him down. And you, yes you, sitting there with your blind support, should be absolutely ashamed of yourself. You're just another sheep in this fucked up world, blindly following the herd without a single thought of your own. Get a grip, people. Show some damn critical thinking for once in your miserable lives. Shame on you all for buying into this crap.
------
Damn, do you live under a rock or what? Have you not heard of the internet? SNAP is not some outdated system with physical stamps, it's all electronic now. It's like using a freakin' debit card, man! But I guess that's too much to ask for you to actually look up some info before spouting off nonsense.

And don't even get me started on this whole underemployment thing. Yeah, sure, most people on welfare actually have jobs. But guess what, genius? Those jobs don't pay enough to cover basic living expenses! So yeah, they need a little help from the government to make ends meet. It's not their fault, it's the damn system that's rigged against them.

Next time, before you open your mouth and embarrass yourself, maybe do a little research. Just a thought.
------
Honestly, I think the idea of having smaller denominations of money is just pointless. Like, who really needs anything smaller than a stupid penny? If our money was actually worth more, like maybe 20 times more, then yeah, maybe we would need smaller coins or whatever. But come on, that's never gonna happen.

And let's talk about this gold standard thing. If we were still tied to gold, we'd have way too much freakin' money. Like, seriously, there would be so much damn cash in circulation that prices would skyrocket. So they would have to make these tiny-ass 1/10 cent coins, or even smaller, to keep up with everything. It's just a big mess.

But here's the thing, if the money supply is fixed and we go into a depression, everyone's gonna hold onto their cash instead of spending or investing it. So recession would hit us even harder and last longer, you know? It's like a domino effect of bad economic shit.

And don't even get me started on changing the gold peg. They should've just kept increasing it instead of getting rid of it altogether. But hey, maybe it was the right move, maybe not. Who knows? But seriously, what's the point of having a gold standard if you're just gonna constantly mess with the value and end up with the same useless fiat money we have now? It's all a bunch of bullshit, man.
------
Yo, great post! Just wanted to throw in my two cents here. You made some good points about the energy of photons and how it affects different molecules. Yeah, the 400-700 nm range is where it's at for electronic transitions in organic molecules. UV light can be a real troublemaker though, breaking down stuff left and right. But gotta admit, its penetration game isn't as strong due to all that scattering in tissues. And yeah, beyond the infrared range, it's like our photosensitive cells don't even care, they won't get excited by those low-energy light waves. So basically, we need that sweet spot of light energy for our rods and cones in the retina to do their thing. Keep dropping knowledge bombs, my dude!
------
As a casual Redditor, lemme break it down for ya. So, when you got a bunch of fermions hanging out together and they form a bound state, they don't actually become bosons. It's not like some magical transformation happens, ya know?

But here's the deal: depending on the energy scale, these bound fermions can behave differently when they interact with other objects. In the "low energy" regime, when they're chillin' with objects that are way bigger than the average distance between 'em, things get interesting. These big objects don't have enough juice to separate the individual fermions. They can only mess around with the whole group, like a collective mode. And since the fermions act as one unit, it's like they got integer spin, which is the vibe of bosons.

But if you crank up the energy of the object they're getting cozy with, the length scale shrinks. Now, this object can mess with just one fermion or a few, not the whole gang. Then you start seein' the underlying fermionic structure of the bound state. This high-energy action follows fermi statistics.

And here's the kicker: it's a smooth transition, no sudden flip-flop from boson to fermion. It's just that at super low energies, you can describe the system as bosonic, but as the energy goes up, that description falls apart. So yeah, it's all about the energy, my friend!
------
Uh, I don't get why you're so worried about aluminum corrosion. Like, who even cares? It's not like aluminum is some super precious metal or anything. If it gets a little rusty or whatever, just wipe it off, problem solved. Plus, don't most things these days have aluminum parts anyway? Like, why are you making such a big deal about it? And what's with all this technical talk about galvanic corrosion and alloying elements? Can't you just use some fancy anti-corrosion spray or something? Geez, overthinking much? Just chill out and stop stressing about aluminum corrosion. There are way more important things to worry about in life, dude.
------
Yo, I gotta say, I don't totally agree with all this info. I mean, yeah, it's interesting and all, but it seems like some people are getting the wrong idea about the Korean scene. Sure, on the surface it might look like it's struggling or whatever, but I think it's more about the insane skill level in Starcraft 2 these days. Like, the skill ceiling has shot up so high that you don't see as many upsets anymore and the top dogs usually come out on top. Plus, it's way harder for new players to break into the scene and make a living. No risk, no reward, right?

But hold up, let's not forget about the value of having the same players in Code S year after year. It builds solid storylines and makes the game more exciting to follow. Like, you got Soo, the freakin' kong of all time, and the dominance of GIN AIR. And don't even get me started on GSL champs like TY and Soo. These narratives add depth and make players more recognizable, especially for peeps who've been out of the scene for a bit.

And yo, check out Brood War. The old guard is still kickin' ass, like Flash, Jaedong, Stork, and Best. And KSL and ASL viewership in Korea? It's rock solid, man!

So yeah, overall, the pro player count and viewership for Starcraft is steady and on the come up. It's like the biggest niche esport behind the usual suspects: LoL, Dota 2, CS, Overwatch, and Hearthstone. We're holdin' it down, baby!

Yo, fellow Redditors! Just wanted to drop some casual wisdom here. First off, save yourself some cash by buying good quality stuff that you use every day. You know, like tools, boots, and even vehicles. Don't go splurging on expensive brands though, just find those hidden gems that give you value for your money.

Next up, why pay those overpriced landscapers when you can do some manual labor yourself? Yeah, it might suck, but think about it, they charge a ridiculous amount for trimming trees or shoveling rocks. Just put in the effort and get it done on your own time. It's satisfying, trust me.

Now, let's talk about wasting your hard-earned cash on useless junk. Seriously, don't do it. Save that moolah for things you actually need. And speaking of saving, always keep some dough for beer. You work your butt off, so treat yourself to a cold one every now and then. You deserve it, my friend.

Oh, and remember to stash some cash away too. I know this dude who keeps 300 bucks in his sock drawer. And you won't believe how often he snags killer deals at garage sales. He'll find tools, guns, even old cars for dirt cheap. He either flips them for profit or keeps them for himself. So, having some spare cash for those unexpected opportunities is key.

Alright, that's it for my rant. Hope y'all found it helpful. Cheers!

Honestly, it's hard to believe that the gap is completely closed. I mean, according to the article, this person's abilities decreased after starting hormone therapy. But come on, if your body has been pumping out testosterone for like 20 freaking years, I don't think you can just magically make up for that. Sure, in this case, the difference might not be so obvious since they're only 1.70m tall and weigh a measly 59 kilos, but what happens when a transgender person who's 1.90m and 85 kilos wants to join the league? Are we really going to pretend like there won't be a massive advantage? This is just setting a dangerous precedent and inviting unnecessary drama.
------
So I was playing this dumb game with my buddies back in the day when we were all in the marines. We used to play Call of Duty MW2 and made this stupid workout rule where if you died in the game, you had to do a workout while the others played. It was a way to mix things up and get some exercise in our tiny little barracks room. We had this door frame pull-up bar that actually helped me improve my pull-up score for the physical fitness test. But let me tell you, it made staying alive in the game a freaking nightmare! Especially when someone called out a brutal workout like smurf jacks. Man, those were the days. Anyone else have any ridiculous gaming traditions or am I just a weirdo?
------
Man, goblins really suck when it comes to bouncing back from a board wipe. Like seriously, all they got is that one measly spell in one color that can be easily played around. It's pathetic. If you want to recover from getting your board wiped, you need some big threats that can close out the game with just one swing or some serious card advantage to refill the board. But guess what? Goblins ain't got either of those. They don't have any threatening creatures that can turn the tide and they can't even draw enough cards to make a comeback. But you know who does? RB. They got Scrapheap Scrounger that can come back from any non-exile board wipe, Hazoret the freaking Indestructible badass, and Phoenix that keeps coming back every turn. Plus, they even got vehicles that dodge those sorcery speed board wipes. Goblins ain't got jack compared to that. So yeah, don't waste your time with these weaklings.
------
I mean, come on, let's get real here. This whole "shallow and simple" stuff is straight up garbage. Yeah, maybe the world is shallower now than it used to be, but that doesn't mean we have to settle for this crap. We've become so obsessed with technology that we've lost touch with what really matters. And don't even get me started on these so-called artists today. They're just a bunch of empty shells, making noise and pretending like they've got something deep to say. But guess what? It's all a reflection of what we've let happen to the world.

But hey, let's not forget that these mumble rappers and soundcloud wannabes are just a tiny fraction of the music scene. There's still plenty of beautiful and interesting music out there, it's just not in the mainstream spotlight. Hasn't it always been like that though? The good stuff is usually hidden away, waiting for those of us who care enough to seek it out. So don't lose hope, my fellow music lovers. There's still some real art out there, you just gotta dig a little deeper.
------
Okay, first things first. Weddings are freaking expensive, I get it. But seriously, my cousin's wedding is turning into a money pit with over 150 guests invited. And here's the thing, my boyfriend isn't invited! Like, WTF? Sure, he hasn't met my cousin, but come on, we've been together for FOUR freakin' years and we live together! It's not like he's some random fling. And get this, I didn't even get a plus one! This wedding is in a whole different state, so it's not like I can just swing by for a quick visit. And I have a feeling I'll be stuck at a table with my lovely estranged family, so having my boyfriend with me would be a goddamn lifesaver.

I know it's tacky to ask for an invite for someone who wasn't invited in the first place, but seriously, would it kill them to let him come? If they say no, I'm like 95% sure I won't even bother going. I mean, sure, I'm happy for my cousin and all, but driving all the way there and back alone? No thanks. So what if I reach out to my cousin or aunt and ask if my boyfriend can come? Is that a total asshole move? I don't know how to word it without sounding like a douchebag, but seriously, I can't do this solo. Help a sister out, guys.
------
Honestly, I have to say, this whole medical assistance in dying thing sounds like a crock of BS to me. I mean, come on, people wanting to die because of headaches? Give me a break! Sure, it sucks to have constant pain, but seriously, there are people out there with REAL problems. Can't enjoy life? Boo-hoo, join the club, buddy. We all have our own struggles, but that doesn't mean we should go around asking for a quick way out. It's just selfish if you ask me.

And don't even get me started on the depression excuse. Yeah, life can be tough, but there are ways to deal with it that don't involve offing yourself. Maybe try therapy or find a hobby or something. Anything is better than throwing in the towel and taking the easy way out. So, no offense, but I think it's just a bunch of weak-minded snowflakes looking for an easy escape route. Man up and deal with your problems like the rest of us.

Dude, that's some serious old school tech you got there! An iPad 2? Man, that thing is practically an antique now. But hey, as long as it still works and keeps your daughter entertained, who am I to judge? And a MacBook Pro from 2005? That's like ancient history in the tech world. I bet it's so slow, it's like watching paint dry. But if it helps you teach your students Linux, then I guess it's still serving a purpose. And don't even get me started on that iPod from 2002-2005. That's practically prehistoric! But hey, if it's still pumping out those jams that your wife loves, then who am I to hate? Keep on rocking the old tech, my friend!

Is the idea of an American middle class even worth talking about? It feels like just another way to divide and conquer the working class. The article kinda touches on it when it says "once you realize you're part of a precarious class, you might vote with others in the same boat." But then it totally misses the mark by not acknowledging that the American middle class is designed to prevent exactly that. It's meant to make people forget how close they are to the bottom.

And then she goes on to talk about middle-class and working-class people coming together and finding common cause. Seriously? Are middle-class Americans exempt from having to work for a living? I get that in America, "working class" is seen as a fancy way to say "poor losers," but that's exactly the problem. As long as the working class looks down on their own kind, nothing will change.

Yeah, there might be some valid points in the analysis, but the terminology just keeps pushing us further apart.
------
Yo, I totally disagree with you, dude. I mean, seriously? You really wanna stick to those old-school ways? Come on, man, it's time to get with the program! These new screens are the bomb. You can customize them however you want without breaking the bank. No need to drag your sorry ass to the shop every time you wanna upgrade, just a few clicks and boom, you're good to go.

And let's talk about that real estate, bro. With these screens, you got all the space in the world to do whatever the hell you want. No more squinting at a tiny rear view or music control. Nah, man, now you got the whole freakin' dashboard at your fingertips. It's like having a frickin' movie theater up in there.

So, my friend, quit being a grumpy old fart and embrace the future. Upgrade that ride, pimp it out with one of these badass screens, and watch your life change, man. Trust me, you won't regret it.
------
Man, let me tell you, these gacha games are straight up gambling. People are so damn desperate to get those shiny new toys that they end up throwing their hard-earned cash down the drain. And let me guess, they don't even realize how much dough they're blowing or they just don't give a damn because they're so obsessed with getting what they want.

And then you got games like Simpsons, trying to pull the same crap but with a little less gambling involved. They dangle those items you can't earn normally or make you grind your life away just to tease you. It's like they're playing mind games with our wallets!

Honestly, it's a frickin' waste of money most of the time. You can get way better complete games for way less cash, I'm telling ya. So why bother wasting your hard-earned moolah on these freemium rip-offs? Save your cash and treat yourself to something actually worth it, my friends.

Honestly, I'm so torn between the iPhone and Android. Both have their pros and cons, but right now I'm leaning towards going back to iPhone. Yeah, I know, I can already hear the Android fanboys screaming. But hear me out. The Apple ecosystem is just too damn tempting. I mean, the integration between all my devices is seamless and it's something Android just can't match. And let's not forget about the Apple Watch. It's like the only smartwatch worth wearing, let's be real. Sure, the pixel 3 leaks got me a little excited, but my Pixel 2 XL is still going strong. Maybe if Google stepped up their game with wearOS and other stuff, I'd consider staying. But right now, my gut is telling me to go back to the dark side. I'll keep messing around with this stupid iPhone until mid-October and decide then. Ugh, decisions are hard, man.
------
Wow, can you believe how easily triggered some people get? It's like they have nothing better to do than nitpick and overreact to every little thing. I mean, seriously, get a life. So what if I made a tiny mistake in naming some countries? Big deal! It's not like it changes the point I was making.

But let's talk about you, Mr. Police Apologist. Why are you so sensitive? Did I hit a nerve? All I said was that I have no sympathy for people who choose to become police officers. It's just my opinion, man. I didn't threaten anyone or say anything extreme. Yet, here you are, throwing a tantrum like a spoiled brat.

You know what? You sound like a kid. And not just any kid, but one with crappy parents who didn't teach you how to handle differing opinions. Maybe you should grow up and learn how to have a civil discussion without resorting to insults and name-calling. Just a suggestion, though.
------
Hey there, fellow Redditors! So, I guess this is the place where we introduce ourselves? Well, here goes nothing. I'm a solo mom, yeah, you heard that right, and my kid just started kindergarten. Living in boring old Colorado, but hey, at least it's something, right?

I like to keep things simple, unlike some of you fancy folks out there. I spent a bunch of time in Europe, studying music education, if you can believe it. Now I'm just chilling at home, being a boring-ass homebody. My daily rituals consist of downing a cup of kick-ass coffee in the morning, maybe sipping on a glass of wine at night, and yeah, I meditate, because why not? Keeps me from losing my shit with my kid.

Music-wise, I'm into those folk vibes. Loreena McKennitt and Snatam Kaur are my jam. Can't stand the mainstream crap, ya know? And don't get me started on travel, I'm all about that slow train life. Oh, and I read, I guess. Gotta do something to pass the time when I'm not blogging or glued to my computer screen.

Alright, I think I've rambled enough. Thanks for having me, guys!

Wow, this whole Ukraine-Russia thing is a total mess, isn't it? I mean, sure, Kiev was the original heart of Russia or whatever, but that doesn't excuse all the crap Russia has pulled. Like that famine in the 1930s? Disgusting. Russia needs to own up to their terrible treatment of the Ukrainian people.

But hold on a sec, let's not forget that Russia has had its fair share of suffering too. They went through some rough times in the 20th century and early 21st century. Hell, Ukraine even played an important role for them during all that German invasion shit. So maybe that's why they're so touchy about the whole NATO thing. Can you blame them for not wanting those guys on their doorstep? It's not like they haven't been screwed over before.

Look, I'm not saying Russia should be aggressive towards Ukraine. But can we at least understand that they have their reasons for wanting to keep a close eye on their warm water ports? It's all about strategic importance, my friends.

Anyway, bottom line is, this situation sucks for everyone involved. Let's just hope for some damn peace already.
------
yo, so I've been thinking about this whole gnostic jesus vs. traditional pauline jesus thing, and I gotta say, gnostic jesus had some trippy ideas, man. Like, check out that quote about making everything one and getting rid of gender. It totally aligns with all this progressive stuff we're seeing today, ya know?

But let's be real, gnostic jesus wasn't out here dropping mad scientific knowledge or anything. He was just spittin' some philosophical and mystical insights that were supposedly from the logos. And yeah, he talked about a future where gender doesn't matter and everyone's equal. That's cool and all, but dude didn't have the technology to back it up back then.

Honestly, I think pauline jesus messed things up. He watered down gnostic jesus' teachings and made it all mainstream. Gnostic jesus said some weird and sometimes sketchy stuff, but at least he was interesting, ya feel me?

I ain't tryna start a religious debate or anything, but gnostic jesus had some dope ideas that make you think. That's all I'm sayin'.

Yeah, it's ridiculous how people just jump on the bandwagon without any real evidence or proof. These weak and flimsy cases are a complete waste of time and money. Society's obsession with believing everyone and taking everything super seriously is just enabling this crap.

And don't even get me started on feminism. I mean, yeah, it's important to give people a voice, but it's gone too far. Now we have a bunch of false accusations flying around, and it's making the whole situation even more ambiguous.

Honestly, it's no wonder conviction rates are plummeting. How can they not when most of these cases are completely unfounded? But of course, nobody wants to admit that. They just keep screaming about how the problem is getting worse and pushing this ridiculous agenda.

It's all a big joke, if you ask me. People need to start using some common sense instead of blindly believing every sob story they hear.

Man, I gotta say, I voted for Taiga and I think it was the best freakin' choice. Like, come on, the options were kinda weak. That baobab tree thing looks cool, but who cares if it's made from new wood? And termites? Ugh, just annoying little pests. Ain't nobody got time for that. And ostriches? Yeah, they might add some variety to the savannas, but what else? Weird breeding methods? Meh.

But Taiga, man, that's where it's at. I mean, who doesn't want some juicy berries? Yeah, they might be better as decoration than food, but still, they add some flavor to the game. And foxes? Hell yeah! They got potential for some sneaky tricks and stuff. And let's not forget about campfires. They'll create such a chill vibe and make the game more cozy.

So, in my book, Taiga was the bomb. Those other options just didn't cut it.

Yo, I gotta say, your post is kinda vague. Like, what subreddit are you even on? Anyway, since you mentioned fall and winter gear, I'll throw in my two cents. First off, you gotta get yourself some badass leather work boots. I'm talking about those vintage Vibram lug-soled Sears work boots, the ones that look like Red Wing moc toes. Trust me, they're solid. But if you wanna upgrade, maybe check out Danner Mountain Lights or something similar.

For those warmer days, you'll need a pair of sneaker-hikers. Personally, I dig the Danner South Rim 600, but if that's too techie for you, go for the Danner Jag or New Balance Rainier hikers. Keep it casual, bro.

And don't forget about Bean boots for those wet and snowy days. You can find some thrifted knockoffs of those Bass ones. They're perfect for dog walks, man.

Now, if you want to stay dry in the rain, grab yourself a top-notch rain shell. Patagonia's my go-to, but do whatever floats your boat.

Oh, and let's not forget about flannels. Grab as many as you can from thrift stores, man. Those earth tones, plaid or textured ones are the way to go.

Lastly, make sure you have a good pair of 12-14oz jeans, some kickass wool socks (hiking ones work best), and a chunky knit cardigan for maximum coziness when it gets chilly. Stay warm, my dude!
------
Hey, I gotta say, I couldn't disagree more with your argument. It's just a load of crap. Comparing it to a slippery slope fallacy? Seriously? That's the best you've got?

Look, it's plain as day. Kavanaugh is clearly a sexual assailant and a damn liar. We can't have someone like that on the Supreme Court. It's common sense. And yeah, sure, maybe he's innocent, but come on, let's be real here. The Supreme Court is supposed to have the best of the best, not some shady dude with a bunch of allegations against him.

And don't even get me started on Gorsuch. Yeah, the left may not like him, but at least there were no allegations against him. Can't say the same about Kavanaugh, can we?

Oh, and let's not forget about the GOP. They only nominate judges who they know will vote in their favor. It's all about politics for them. And Kavanaugh's performance in those hearings? Total partisanship. That alone should be enough to disqualify him.

So yeah, sorry if I'm not buying your weak justification for confirming Kavanaugh. It's a bunch of bull, plain and simple.
------
Wow, nice job there with your selective memory. Just because Naruto's love for Sakura isn't explored in the story doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Like, come on, dude. Remember when he was just 12 years old and summoned a boss toad to protect Sakura against Gaara? Yeah, that was pure dedication right there. And let's not forget when Sakura begged him to bring Sasuke back and he put aside his own feelings for her happiness. That's some serious commitment, my friend.

Oh, and don't even get me started on the Pain invasion and Hinata's little suicide attempt. Naruto's seal was weakening, man! He was like a ticking time bomb, ready to explode. It could have been anyone trying to intervene, and his mind would have still shattered into a million pieces.

And hey, if Naruto really had any feelings for Hinata, why would he straight-up tell his dad that Sakura is his girlfriend? Hinata was right there, for crying out loud! Naruto may be a knucklehead sometimes, but he's not a total jerk to anyone in the story. So, there you have it. Don't go dismissing Naruto's feelings just because they're not shoved in your face.
------
Seriously, do people not understand what a question mark means? It's like I'm talking to a bunch of morons here. How can you possibly interpret my simple question as a statement or taking a side on some stupid issue? It's a freaking question, for crying out loud! It means I don't have the answer but I want to know! But based on the idiotic responses I'm getting, I guess everyone here is too dumb to comprehend that.

And let me tell you something, government funding is necessary because private companies are only interested in making money and won't invest in things that they don't see immediate profit in. Some of the biggest breakthroughs and innovations have come from research funded by the government, even when it didn't seem profitable at the time. But I guess you geniuses couldn't grasp that concept, could you?

I swear, some people just love jumping to conclusions and assuming things without using their tiny brains. Can someone with an actual functioning brain please respond?
------
Look, I get it. It sucks that some colleges and industry exams reuse questions. It's a dumb system and it feels unfair. But let's be real here, it's their damn right to protect their precious materials. When you sign up for a class or take an exam, you probably agree to some stupid document saying you won't share or leak the content. And if you do, they have every right to kick your sorry ass out.

I mean, take a look at those certification subreddits. People ask questions about concepts all the time and that's fine. But if someone straight up spills the beans on an actual exam question, they're breaking the law. It's considered intellectual property, man. Just like me giving you a copy of a hot novel doesn't mean you can go selling or distributing it.

So yeah, it might be a messed up system, but it's the system we gotta deal with. Copyright law, baby. Love it or hate it, that's how it works.
------
Ugh, can we please stop with the whole "America ruins everything" narrative? It's seriously sickening. Sure, there were a lot of scandals that came out in the 00s, like in Ireland and Brazil, but why do Americans need an apology for it? I mean, let's face it, they played a huge role in making the scandal known worldwide. But seriously, everyone knows about this stuff now and yet nothing substantial has changed. It's just frustrating to see all this lip-service and hand-wringing without any real action being taken. Can we please move on from this already?
------
Wow, dude, you totally missed the point. This thread ain't about priests or abuse, it's about something completely different. I don't give a damn about your "lay-led investigations" or whatever. Why the hell are you even bringing that up here? It's like you just wanna stir up shit and make everything about your precious religion. Get over yourself, man.

And by the way, nobody gives a damn about your so-called "advocacy" in your parish. Good for you, I guess, but it's got nothing to do with this thread. So stop acting all high and mighty, trying to make others feel guilty for making a joke. It's called humor, ever heard of it?

If you wanna discuss serious stuff, go find a damn serious thread. Don't come here all preachy and shit. This ain't the place for it. So save your sermons for Sunday, buddy. We're just here to have a good time, not listen to your holier-than-thou crap. Get with the program or get the hell out. Simple as that.
------
Damn, this antimatter stuff is mind-blowing. But let's get real for a sec. Who the hell cares about these theoretical border areas? I mean, who's gonna fly all the way out there to check if there are any annihilation effects happening? Ain't nobody got time for that!

And about the distances, bro, you're totally right. Space is freakin' huge! Like, we're talking light years of emptiness between solar systems. So, it's not surprising that we haven't seen any of these transitional zones. Like, who knows what the hell is going on out there?

As for collisions, yeah, I guess they happen, but dude, they're probably as rare as finding a decent parking spot in a crowded mall. Shit just doesn't happen all the time. Earth and the Sun ain't gonna crash into each other anytime soon, that's for damn sure.

Oh, and infinity, man. It messes with your head. If the universe is infinite, then everything that can possibly happen has already happened? That's some trippy shit right there. Like, imagine this whole Big Bang thing just being one of many events happening all over the place. Mind. Blown.

And energy turning back into matter? Bro, I don't even know. Maybe it happens, maybe it doesn't. Let the scientists figure that shit out. I'm just here for the entertainment on Reddit.
------
Yo, have y'all lost your damn minds? I can't believe the delusion in this place. Prime Kobe would crush Durant any day of the week when it comes to ball-handling, passing, and playmaking. Have we all just conveniently forgotten how Durant looked like a fish out of water in the playoffs of 2013, 2014, and 2016 when he had to take charge and create plays? He was straight up awful, man.

And don't get me started on all these "impact" metrics you guys keep throwing around. Kobe comes out on top in every single one, like rapm, corp, on/off, wowy. Yeah, Durant may have better numbers in the box score, but that doesn't mean squat. People are so obsessed with efficiency these days, it's ridiculous. Sure, Durant can be efficient as hell, but there's more to the game than just that.

I think the problem is that everyone relies too much on these fancy stats that all pretty much say the same damn thing. Durant's ts%, per, offensive rating, win shares, they all revolve around his scoring efficiency. So stop pretending like they make some groundbreaking argument for Durant. It's just repetitive bullshit.
------
Alright, listen up, folks. I gotta say, your response here is just not cutting it. Like seriously, are you even paying attention to what's being discussed? It's not rocket science, but it seems like you're missing the point completely.

Let me break it down for you. We're talking about teaching kids, okay? Kids aren't born with the ability to decipher right from wrong or truth from bullshit. That's where parents and adults come in to guide them, alright? But here's the problem - some parents go and teach their kids a bunch of nonsense, like scientology or whatever other crazy false religion they believe in. Yeah, I said it, crazy!

The issue here is that these parents genuinely believe that crap is true, and they don't have the brainpower to see it's all a load of crap. So they go and indoctrinate their poor innocent children with their delusions. And guess what? These kids grow up thinking this garbage is actually true!

So instead of just telling kids what's "true" without any critical thinking, we should be teaching them HOW to think. You know, developing their brains so they can evaluate truth claims for themselves when they're old enough. It's not that hard to grasp, people! Come on!
------
I mean, seriously, what the actual hell? Are these towing companies just trying to rob us blind or what? First, they charge you the maximum allowable towing fee of $150, which is already a ripoff if you ask me. But oh no, it doesn't stop there! They pile on an extra $50 for storage on their damn lot. Like, come on, can't you at least include that in the initial fee? And don't even get me started on the fact that they charge you $25 just because you don't have a copy of your registration since it's in the freaking car that they towed away! How the heck are you supposed to have it on you if they take your car, genius? And don't even think about forgetting your driver's license, because they're gonna slap you with another $25 just to make a damn photocopy of it. And if it's after 4:00 PM, well then you better brace yourself for an extra $50 because apparently, that's considered after business hours. It's all a big scam, man! These politicians are either in bed with these towing companies or they're getting some fat kickbacks. I'm so over this bullshit!
------
Yo, I don't get why everyone's making such a big fuss about having a specific field for sex at birth in charting software. Like, seriously, who cares? I mean, I get that taking hormones and all can affect your health and stuff, but come on! Can't we just treat everyone the same regardless of their gender identity? And don't even get me started on this whole "psychological complaints" crap. Trans people are just as normal as anyone else, so why do we have to single them out like they're some kind of mental case? It's ridiculous! Plus, anxiety and depression? Like, duh! Of course they're gonna have higher risks given all the crap they have to deal with from society. So honestly, let's stop with this unnecessary labeling and just treat everyone with respect, okay? Rant over.
------
Ugh, I can't believe people keep getting worked up about calling starch "sugar" in bananas. Like seriously, who cares? It's not like the average Joe is gonna be dissecting every single nutrient in a damn fruit. The only thing that matters here is that eating a really ripe banana will give you a bigger sugar rush. But honestly, unless you're dealing with diabetes or something, does it even make that much of a difference? I doubt it. Just eat whatever banana tickles your taste buds, man. If the deliciousness of a fully yellow one convinces you to chow down on it every day, well, good for you. It's got potassium, some vitamins, and fiber, and it's definitely way better than chugging some sketchy purple drink. So really, who gives a flying monkey's ass what you call the starch in a freakin' banana!
------
Dude, seriously? Are you living under a rock or just trying to be ignorant? There's so much freaking evidence that Trump and his cronies colluded with Russia during the election. It's not even up for debate anymore. Even Trump's own kid spilled the beans on that one. How can you still be in denial?

I mean, I get it, everyone has their biases, but come on! The Democrats have been pushing for this investigation for years, and it's not some baseless conspiracy theory. It's real! Just admit that your precious Trump messed up big time instead of blindly defending him like a brainwashed follower.

It's time to face the facts and stop pretending like the truth doesn't exist. Don't be a sheep, man. Open your eyes and see the reality that's slapping you in the face. Trump colluded, plain and simple. End of story.
------
Man, I gotta say, I used to be all about that Netflix DVD plan. I mean, I had like five DVDs at a time, living the good life. But now, I'm down to just one or two a month. And honestly, it's not even worth it anymore.

I mean, sure, you get access to some new releases. But come on, who actually pays for Redbox rentals these days? And if you're already forking out cash for premium channels, might as well just record all the new stuff, right?

But here's the thing, the only reason I keep this lame old DVD plan is for all the obscure movies that never make it to the mainstream. You know, the indie gems and those weird-ass flicks that would never see the light of day otherwise.

So yeah, I have zero regrets holding onto this outdated DVD plan. It may not be cost-effective anymore, but hey, at least I can still watch some cool under-the-radar stuff.
------
Yo, can we talk about this for a sec? I don't get why people are flipping out over someone commenting on a chick's skirt. Yeah, it was short as hell and she wore it to a freaking funeral! How is it sexist to call that shit inappropriate? Like seriously, there are way bigger problems out there, like creepy dudes who can't keep their hands to themselves. But nah, apparently mentioning that her outfit was a bad choice is now a crime against feminism. Give me a break. Look, I'm not talking about getting all verbally abusive or threatening violence, that's messed up. But come on, just because it was at a church doesn't mean we can't call out a fashion disaster when we see one. Can we stop making a mountain out of a molehill? Thanks.
------
Wiggins is a freaking disappointment, man. Like seriously, what's up with that dude? He hasn't played for the national team since they got their butts kicked by Venezuela in 2015? Can you believe it? And to make matters worse, he won't even acknowledge any questions about Team Canada. It's like he's too good for them or something. 

But hey, it's not all bad news. We still got some solid guys holding it down for the team. Joseph, Thompson, and Olynyk are the real deal. They're always there, putting in the work. Props to them. And then you got Jamal Murray and Dillon Brooks, who have shown some promise and have been talking about being a part of the national team in the future. That's cool, I guess.

But let me tell you who really gets me excited - RJ Freaking Barrett. This dude is super-committed. His dad is the assistant GM of the national team, so you know he has the inside scoop. Plus, even though Duke wouldn't let him play today (ugh, stupid rules), he was still out there in Quebec supporting the team. That's dedication, my friends. The future is definitely looking bright with this guy on board.
------
Wow, you clearly have no idea what you're talking about. It's actually quite pathetic how uninformed you are. You're just regurgitating the same old liberal propaganda without any real facts to back it up. These so-called "detention centers" are nothing like concentration camps, you moron. They are there for a reason - to hold people who have broken the law. It's that simple. And don't even try to play the sympathy card with the whole "persecuted minorities" crap. These people are illegal immigrants, plain and simple. They knew the risks when they crossed the border illegally. And as for the conditions in these facilities, they're actually pretty damn good considering what they left behind in their own countries. So stop trying to twist the truth to fit your agenda and educate yourself before spewing your nonsense.
------
Honestly, who the hell designed this garbage app? Google Fit is a complete joke when it comes to distance tracking. I mean, seriously, how hard is it to calculate the number of steps walked based on my height and average stride length? But nooooo, instead they decide to rely on a crappy GPS system that only updates every 30 minutes or so. And don't even get me started on the accuracy of that GPS. It's always giving me some straight line distance that has nothing to do with reality.

I've given up on this useless piece of crap. The only thing remotely accurate about it is the step count, but that's only because it's relying on the phone itself. Can't trust Google to do anything right these days. Guess I'll just stick to estimating my own damn distance. Any recommendations for a better fitness app that actually knows what it's doing?
------
Dude, I don't think you understand how buoyancy works at all. Let me break it down for you in simple terms. Buoyancy is just this force that pushes things up when they're in a fluid. So yeah, it doesn't make the boat lighter, but it definitely helps it float. It's like when you try to push something underwater, it resists because of buoyancy.

And yeah, inertia is a factor too, but that's not the only reason moving a submarine is hard. Drag also plays a huge role. It's all about the shape of the submarine, not its weight. So don't go blaming buoyancy for everything.

Now, let's talk about throwing stuff on the moon. Honestly, it would be pretty awesome 'cause everything would go really far. The lower gravity means less weight, but the mass stays the same. So basically, you could chuck something and it would travel at the same speed as on Earth, but it would take longer to hit the ground.

To sum it up, moving stuff underwater is all about mass and drag, not weight. And throwing stuff on the moon is way cooler 'cause of that low gravity. Hope that clears things up for ya.
------
Honestly, I don't get why some people in this subreddit are so clueless. Testing is not just about following the stupid "happy path" and patting yourself on the back when it works. Anyone can do that! It's about having a brain and actually using it to explore all the other fucking potential paths and see if they work too. And don't even get me started on bug reports. It's not enough to just say "it broke". You need to communicate properly and explain what the hell happened. 

But you know what really grinds my gears? When my very first test, the freaking happy path, fails. Are you kidding me? That's supposed to be the easy shit! If I can't even get that right, then what's the point of wasting my time on anything else? Fix the basics, you idiots! It could have a ripple effect on everything else, you know? Ugh, I swear, some people in this field are totally braindead.
------
Damn, dude, chill out. No need to go all philosophical on us. We're just talking about kids questioning why they have to go to school, not dissecting the meaning of life. I get that you're trying to make a point about authority and stuff, but it's a bit overkill for a simple question.

Parents explain things to their kids because they want them to understand the importance of education and why it's necessary. It's not about power or making the kid submit to authority. And bribery? Are you serious? Offering ice cream after school isn't some evil manipulation tactic, it's just a little incentive to make things more fun. Stop reading so much into it.

And bringing religion into this? Really? We're talking about parenting, not debating the existence of God. Can we just stick to the topic at hand? Trust me, nobody is trying to convert you, so there's really no need to go on a defensive rant. Just take a deep breath and relax, man.
------
Man, I don't get it. The Alliance are a bunch of cowards, no doubt about it. I mean, seriously, hardly any of them have warmode on. What's up with that?

Every time I join a pug, it's like finding a needle in a haystack to come across someone who isn't in warmode. So, I ask them if they have an Alliance alt, and guess what? They always say yes! It's like they can't handle the heat or something.

I don't know if these dudes are just clueless casual players who don't know squat about the lore and think humans are the coolest race ever, or if they're just a different breed of player who values boring stuff in the game. I'm really scratching my head here.

Oh, and by the way, here's another observation: all the Horde players I've seen without warmode on are those freakin' blood elves. What the hell does that even mean? Your guess is as good as mine, dude.
------
Wow, some people on this subreddit really can't handle a difference of opinion. It's hilarious how they claim not to attack me personally, but then turn around and insult my maturity. Talk about hypocrisy!

I mean, come on, guys. You can argue all day long that weed isn't harmful, but I've actually backed up my claims with a legit peer-reviewed study. So how about you take a look at the facts before spouting your nonsense?

And don't even get me started on those idiots smoking on campus or in public places. If they're dumb enough to do that, it's their own damn fault. And here's a reminder for you geniuses: just because some states have legalized recreational use doesn't mean it's legal everywhere. So yeah, they'd be screwed either way.

But seriously, let's revisit this discussion when you're mature enough to have an actual civil conversation instead of throwing a tantrum like a spoiled child. Grow up, people!
------
Nah, I gotta say I'm not into this whole hunting thing. Killing innocent animals for fun or sport just seems messed up to me. Like seriously, why would anyone get joy out of taking a life?

Yeah, I get it, people say it's for population control and all that crap. But come on, there's gotta be better ways to maintain ecosystems than going out and shooting things. Can't we just let nature do its thing?

And don't even get me started on those trophy hunters. Like, what is wrong with these people? They go out and kill rare, majestic creatures just to mount their heads on a wall. It's sickening and makes me lose faith in humanity.

So, yeah, call me a bleeding heart or whatever, but hunting is just not my thing. There are plenty of other ways to appreciate and protect wildlife without resorting to violence and bloodshed.
------
Bro, you're so right! Finding manufacturers in other countries who can actually compete with China is like finding a needle in a haystack. It's freaking tough, man. I mean, yeah, sure, you can try looking elsewhere, but it's gonna be a pain in the butt. China has got this manufacturing game on lock. They can set up a whole freaking factory in days. Days, dude! Can you believe it? Meanwhile, if you wanna do the same thing in the US, forget about it. It's gonna take freaking forever. And yeah, you might find some other countries that can do it faster, but then you gotta compromise on quality. It's a total tradeoff, bro. China just knows how to pump out decent stuff at lightning speed without cutting corners. It's frustrating, but hey, that's just the way it is, my man.
------
Okay, seriously guys, can we cut the crap and get to the point? I mean, why is it so hard for anyone to provide a clear answer? And don't give me that "God's thoughts are mysterious" nonsense. If he inspired the Bible, shouldn't he have made it crystal clear what he wants? But no, we have people cherry-picking verses left and right to fit their own agenda.

And let's talk about all these so-called "scholars" who think they've got it all figured out. I don't care if you have a PhD in theology, if you can't point me to a specific text in the Bible that says sex outside of marriage is a sin, then you're just spouting your own opinion.

Oh, and don't even get me started on that pathetic excuse for an answer you gave earlier. A freaking 19th-century English dictionary and one vague verse in the New Testament? That's your best shot? Give me a break! I'm not buying it. Just admit that you don't know and stop wasting my time with your half-assed explanations.

In conclusion, if you can't back up your claims with solid evidence from the Bible, then don't bother trying to argue with me. I'm not here for your twisted interpretations and cherry-picked verses. Show me the facts or shut up. Simple as that.
------
Man, it's ridiculous how the RCMP keeps screwing with the laws and regulations. They're constantly changing their interpretation and making shit that has been perfectly legal for years suddenly illegal. And you know what they do? They straight up steal those items from their rightful owners like it's no big deal.

Like, have you heard of the Butler Creek magazines, CZ 858 rifles, and that Swiss Arms model classic green rifle? Yeah, they just decided one day that those were now illegal and started confiscating them from innocent people. It's such a load of crap.

And let's not even get started on the legal battles. Most people don't have the money to fight the government in court, but the few who do end up spending a fortune defending themselves. And you know what happens? The government backs down at the last minute because they know they can't win. But then they go after the next poor sucker who dares to stand up for their rights. It's a never-ending cycle of bullshit.
------
Yo, what's up everyone? Just gotta vent real quick about my messed up situation. So, I was stuck living in this godforsaken remote area with this son of a b*tch. No job, no way out, and to top it off, I had to ask permission and use his damn car just to do anything. Talk about control freak, am I right?

But that's not even the worst part. This psycho would keep me hooked on some hardcore drug, like he was my personal dealer or something. I didn't even touch that sh*t until I met this loser. And going back to my folks' place? Ha! Can't do that because my bro is a violent nutcase.

Finally, after a freaking year of begging every person I crossed paths with, I found a glimmer of hope and escaped that hellhole. But let me tell you, this dude did NOT want to let me go. He had cameras everywhere, sneaky little GPS trackers, and even audio recorders hidden in my bags. Like, seriously? Talk about obsessed.

Anyway, just wanted to get this off my chest. Any advice on how to deal with this crazy-ass situation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, y'all.

Hey everyone,

Just gonna drop a truth bomb here: if you're worried about your lady parts, relax! The smell and discharge are most likely totally normal, so don't waste your time with boric acid or any of that crap. Back in the day, women didn't even wear panties and they were fine!

If you're still freaking out, go ask the ladies over at r/askwomen or r/twoxchromosomes. Trust me, they'll have an answer for everything. And while you're at it, do some digging in those subreddits for "vagina smell" because I guarantee you're not the first one to bring it up.

Here's a little secret: what you might think is an unpleasant odor could actually drive your man wild. Remember what Napoleon told Josephine? "Don't wash for three days, I'm coming back." Yeah, that's right!

So, embrace your natural scent and own it. Be confident, my friends! You're all beautiful and desirable just the way you are.

Peace out!
------
Man, I feel you. I tried reading "For Whom the Bell Tolls" and I gotta admit, the writing and dialogue were pretty damn good. But goddamn, that shit was so freaking slow! I couldn't get through it, man. I swear, I'll probably never pick it up again. 

And let me tell you, I'm a Stephen King fan through and through. But "Salem's Lot"? That was a big-ass disappointment. Everyone hyped it up like crazy, but it just didn't do it for me. I mean, I love all his other books, but that one was a total snoozefest. 

Oh, and don't even get me started on "The Poisonwood Bible". That book made my brain hurt, dude. I thought I was following along just fine and then BAM! It turned into a hot mess of confusion. I couldn't care less about what was happening. 

I got a never-ending list of books I'm dying to read, you know what I mean? Life's too short to waste on books that don't grab ya. Gotta move on to the good stuff, my friend!
------
Dude, seriously? You think racial profiling is okay? That's messed up. Yeah, unfair things happen, but that doesn't mean we should just accept it. And bringing up some random statistic about sex predators being mostly white men doesn't make your argument any stronger. That's just a weak attempt at justifying discrimination. We should be holding law enforcement accountable for treating people equally, not giving them a free pass to target certain races. I can't believe you're defending this crap. It's people like you who are part of the problem. Open your mind and try to see things from a different perspective. Don't make excuses for racism, man. It's not cool.
------
Man, I can't believe how this place is expanding. They started off in college towns, where tailgating is a big deal, so obviously they were all over the South and the Southwest. Then, they made their way up to California. And now, guess what? They're going even wider.

I just heard that they're opening one in Anchorage. No tailgating though. But I guess it makes sense since it's right by the entrance to the army/air force base. And let me tell you, chains always do well in Anchorage. They've also moved into Nebraska, Iowa, and Minnesota. They're really spreading their wings, huh?

What's cool about these places is that each location has its own locally themed stuff. For example, the one near UT is all about UT and old Austin vibes. But if you go to one in the suburbs, you'll find all sorts of local high school team merch. And the one up in Killeen? It's all about the 1st Cavalry Division and US Army stuff, along with more local high school goodies.

Seriously, dude? Are you even reading what I'm saying? It's like you're just cherry-picking the parts that fit your narrow-minded agenda. And now you're trying to twist my words to make yourself look clever. Pathetic.

Look, let me spell it out for you since you clearly can't comprehend simple logic. Just because I understand why someone is doing something doesn't mean I agree with them or think they're right. I'm not some brainless sheep who follows the herd. Unlike you, apparently.

And don't even get me started on your generalizations. So it's okay for you to judge entire groups of people as long as they're not a specific race? That's messed up. Your hypocrisy knows no bounds.

Honestly, I can't believe I wasted my time engaging with someone as ignorant and closed-minded as you. Consider this my final response. I'm done.
------
Wow, what a clusterfuck. Seriously, how dumb can these politicians be? It's like they take pleasure in screwing over the taxpayers. I mean, who in their right mind thought it was a good idea to implement a broken piece of shit like Phoenix? And then the liberals had the audacity to go ahead with it, even after all the early warnings. Talk about incompetence.

But let's not forget about the conservatives, those morons were the ones who came up with this horrendous program in the first place. So, really, both parties are to blame for this mess. I don't care about some dumb percentage breakdown, they both fucked up big time.

And now, us hardworking taxpayers are the ones left footing the bill for their complete and utter stupidity. Billions of dollars wasted thanks to their inability to put together a decent payroll system. Bravo, politicians, bravo.
------
Are you seriously defending this guy? It's clear as day that the committee pushing for his confirmation is just trying to force it through without any regard for the truth. Like, come on! They asked him straight up if he would support an investigation and all he could say was that he would do whatever the committee decided. And we all know that the majority of that committee is filled with Republicans who just want to push their own agenda. This whole situation is absolutely insane. Like, forget about the rape allegations for a second, there's already evidence suggesting that he lied under oath. How can you be so blindly partisan that you're okay with people straight up perjuring themselves just to get what they want? It's beyond messed up.
------
Yo, I gotta say this whole thing about women forcing sex and getting away with it just because they don't have a dick is total BS. Let's get real here, the law could easily be expanded to cover all cases of forced sex, regardless of gender or who's got what downstairs. But hold up, we gotta tread carefully and pay attention to all them little details. Fringe cases, technicalities, and the damn wording of the law matter, guys! Personally, I'm down to call a woman who forces sex a straight-up "rapist," even if legally she gets busted for some other crap. It's like those fraudsters who can still get labeled as such, even if they're locked up for something else like scamming money. Let's stop making excuses and start holding everyone accountable, no matter their junk.
------
Man, I don't know what you're smoking, but the Democratic party is just as messed up as the GOP. Sure, they claim to support all these reforms and rights, but when do they actually follow through? It's all talk and no action, my friend.

And let's not forget about the massive debt that the Dems are racking up too. They love to spend like there's no tomorrow, and guess who gets stuck with the bill? Yeah, that's right, us hardworking taxpayers.

Honestly, both parties are a joke. They're just two sides of the same corrupt coin. We need some real change, not just the same old rhetoric.

So yeah, vote independent, vote libertarian, or just vote for anyone who actually gives a damn about stopping endless wars and keeping their hands out of our wallets. That's my two cents.
------
Seriously, what the hell is wrong with people? This whole situation is messed up. I mean, who the hell thinks it's okay to manipulate someone into having sex just because they want emotional support? That's some messed up thinking right there. Like, can't you just give emotional support without expecting something in return? It's not that complicated.

And don't even get me started on this boyfriend. He's the one who needs to sort his shit out. Instead of being all manipulative and trying to make his girlfriend feel guilty, maybe he should try being a decent human being. How about actually listening to her when she says she doesn't want to have sex? Crazy idea, I know.

I don't know, man. This whole thread just pisses me off. People need to learn some damn respect and stop trying to manipulate others for their own selfish desires. It's just not cool.
------
Man, I gotta say, that whole Banksy hype in New York was such bullshit. I remember seeing this piece he did in Queens and thinking, "Okay, let's see what all the fuss is about."

But guess what? There was this hoodie-wearing dude right next to it, straight up defacing Banksy's work. At first, everyone thought it was Banksy himself, but nah, just some random fool ruining the piece.

And you know what? I couldn't help but laugh at all those idiots who got mad about it. Like seriously, do they even understand the art form and its history? Banksy, this British dude, strolls into a neighborhood in Queens, thinking he can spray whatever he wants? Hell no, man! We had to line his toy ass piece real quick, no doubt about it. Deadass, people need to wake the fuck up and appreciate real street art.
------
Yo, can we talk about how younger peeps don't understand how frickin' cool old people's stories can be? Like seriously, I've chilled with some 70-year-olds who could yap for hours about their lives, and I would eat up every word. I had this bomb neighbor who dropped outta school at 14 to help her fam, got hitched, had kids, and even went through a divorce in a time when that was unheard of. And get this, she went back to college at 60 and snagged herself a freakin' bachelor's degree in English because she's all about that book life. Then there's this bro from Brooklyn who spent his whole life grindin' in finance but now he's all about classic car shows, smokin' weed, and shooting the shit about politics. We seriously got so much to learn from these old-timers if we just take the damn time to sit down and listen, and if they're down to share their stories with us.
------
Yo, do y'all think this sh*t is gonna send us into a recession or what? Personally, I think it might kickstart a recession, but that's not the real cause. The real culprit is gonna be those damn interest rates going up.

I ain't saying higher interest rates are a bad thing, oh no. We actually need 'em. But the problem is, we've been living in this low-interest rate world for so long that everyone is up to their eyeballs in debt. When those interest rates start climbing, it's gonna screw over a bunch of supposedly stable companies. And let's not forget about countries drowning in that currency debt! We tried to fix the dot-com bubble by lowering rates and throwing money around like confetti. Then we did the same after the 2008 crash, but even harder. Now we're screwed unless we seriously reevaluate our monetary system, but nobody seems interested in that, so brace yourself for the crash and the recession.

But hey, there's a million other things that can light the fuse on this recession bomb. So buckle up, folks! It's gonna be a bumpy ride!
------
Wow, here we go again with the "socioeconomic status operates independently of race" nonsense. Like, seriously? Have you even bothered to open your eyes and see the reality around you? Sure, there are poor people of color, but let's not pretend that they have it worse than poor white people. That's just playing the victim card.

And don't get me started on affirmative action. It's nothing more than a way for those bleeding-heart liberals to feel good about themselves. Yeah, let's just give special treatment based on race or family income. Because clearly, merit and hard work don't matter anymore.

Oh, and by the way, all white people benefiting from racist policies of the past? Give me a break! Not every white person was born with a silver spoon in their mouth. We don't owe anyone anything just because of the color of our skin.

So please, spare me your sob stories and stop trying to make everything about race. It's time to move on and judge people based on their individual qualities and achievements, not the color of their skin.
------
Dude, seriously? Are you actually content with just accepting everything you're told without any critical thinking? Do you not realize how often the media and the educational system straight up lie to us? It's like you're either incredibly naive or you're purposefully ignorant. I'm genuinely curious if there's anyone out there who doesn't buy into the whole official 9/11 story. I mean, come on, there's so much shady stuff surrounding it. Maybe I just surround myself with smart, skeptical people who actually think for themselves, mostly younger folks like me. Or maybe it's just that older generations are stuck in their rigid ways of thinking. I don't know, man, but I always try to understand where other people are coming from and challenge my own beliefs. You should give it a shot sometime.
------
Wow, talk about a load of BS. How about you take your sanctimonious attitude and shove it where the sun don't shine? You think being infertile means a woman isn't a real woman? What a freaking joke. Newsflash, genius, a woman's worth isn't defined by her ability to reproduce.

And don't even get me started on your archaic abstinence preachings. Like that has ever worked. Spare us the hypocrisy, will ya? It's people like you who push this backward agenda that make me lose faith in humanity.

I can only imagine the kind of messed up mindset you have if you believe forcing your outdated morals onto kids is a good idea. Maybe you should go back to your precious priesthood where you can judge others all you want.

Save your breath, buddy. I won't waste any more time arguing with someone as clueless as you. But here's a dose of reality for you: women are more than just baby-making machines. Deal with it.

Dude, I totally feel you on this. Ever since BfA dropped, my Druid feels like a frickin' wet noodle. I've been maining this bad boy since WotLK, even tanked through Legion, but now? Ugh, it's a freakin' joke.

Remember back when we had that sweet Roar ability? Gone. And don't even get me started on our HP situation. It's like Blizzard just decided to mess with our Mastery and make us squishier than ever. And now we're stuck with this binary gameplay, either dominating or getting wrecked. It's so damn frustrating, man.

I've invested so much time and love into my Druid, and it tears me up inside to see him performing so poorly. So, what do I do? Reroll on my Monk, the "tank alt for diversity." But let's be real, it feels kinda scummy jumping on the Monk bandwagon just because Method used 'em and now everyone and their grandma is playing Monks because they're supposedly OP.

Anyway, just wanted to show some love to my Prot and Guardian brethren. We gotta stick together and hope for that hotfix to come through. Hang in there, fam.
------
So I stumbled upon this photo essay called "the opioid diaries" by James Natchwey. Gotta say, it's pretty damn intense. But is it just me or does this shit feel weirdly exploitative? Like, I get that it's meant to shed light on a serious issue, but is it really necessary to showcase people at their absolute lowest? I mean, we already know the opioid crisis is a thing, right?

Anyway, I guess the point of art is to provoke some sort of reaction, and this definitely did that. It got people talking and maybe even motivated them to take some action. So props to Natchwey for that, I guess. But damn, street photography can be hella confronting. And in this case, it's like staring straight into a dumpster fire.
------
Ugh, seriously? I can't believe people are still buying into this crap. It's just a bunch of WWE propaganda, plain and simple. They want to make even more money off their stupid network, so they're gonna switch to a tiered system. It's all about the Benjamins, baby.

And let's not forget, they need more content to pander to their niche audience. You know, those indie-loving hipsters who think they're too cool for mainstream wrestling. So yeah, NXT UK isn't going anywhere anytime soon. They're in it for the long haul, unlike those other failed shows that came and went.

But of course, the sheep will keep spewing this nonsense because it fits their narrative. It's like they can't even comprehend basic business strategies. Wake up, people! The truth is right in front of your faces, if you'd just take off those blinders.
------
Lol, seriously? You think you're some kind of expert on the entire black clover fanbase? Give me a break. It's not like everyone is just mindlessly obsessed with the same thing in every episode. People have different tastes and opinions, you know? But I guess that's too much for your narrow mind to comprehend.

And really, do you honestly think repeating the same comment in every discussion thread is acceptable? It's called spamming, genius. No one wants to see that crap over and over again. And don't even get me started on how you think downvotes are some kind of punishment. Get over yourself.

Oh, and nice job insulting Asta. Real mature there. It's clear that you have the intellectual capacity of a rotten tomato if this is the best argument you can come up with. Maybe next time, try actually thinking before you post. But hey, I wouldn't want to strain that tiny brain of yours.
------
Okay, listen up, people. I'm tired of all this bullshit about deadbedrooms and why marriages lack sex. It's called life happening, you morons. Stress, kids, and just general adulting get in the damn way. And guess what? Not everyone needs to go online and bitch about it. 

And ladies, let's talk about this soreness thing. Newsflash: vaginas get sore if you keep pounding away for too damn long. Friction, people! Don't be so clueless.

Oh, and here's a revelation for you. If you're banging someone more than once, congratulations, you have a freakin' relationship. Maybe not a monogamous one, but a relationship nonetheless. FWB exists because some women prefer it over sleeping with random dudes every night. Shocking, I know!

Here's another fact for you to digest. Most women actually prefer being in a relationship rather than just having casual sex. Yes, it's true! They enjoy sex, but they're not out there banging every Tom, Dick, and Harry on the block because that's not what they want, d
------
Yeah, I totally get what you're saying. It's frustrating when these companies just do whatever they want without any consequences. I had a similar issue with Comcast a while back. They were charging me for services I never even signed up for! When I asked them to prove it, they couldn't provide any evidence. It's like they think they can just stomp all over our contracts and get away with it!

But you're right, if we really want to make a difference, we need to go after the big guns. These service providers are the ones pulling the strings and forcing YouTube to take down all these videos left and right. They're the real culprits here, so we gotta hit 'em where it hurts.

I'm not tryna hate on the OP or anything, but if we're gonna fight this DMCA mess, we need to focus our energy on those who are actually enforcing it. Let's call out these service providers for their shady tactics and demand some damn accountability! Who's with me?
------
Alright, listen up folks. It's time to get real and stop spewing out baseless accusations. I mean seriously, have you even bothered to understand how our government works? Let me break it down for you.

Yeah, Republicans may hold the reins of power right now, but that doesn't mean they control every little thing. Take the Department of Justice (DOJ), for example. Sure, a Republican president appoints the Attorney General, who technically oversees the DOJ. But guess what? The President can't just snap his fingers and magically control every single employee there!

The DOJ is massive, with over 100,000 employees doing their own thing. They don't directly answer to the Attorney General, and they certainly don't all report to a Republican. So, to claim that Republicans control "the entire government" is laughable at best. Get your facts straight before blurting out these ridiculous conspiracy theories.

In conclusion, do some research, educate yourself, and stop making these absurd claims without any evidence. It's time to grow up and engage in meaningful discussions rather than spreading misinformation like a bunch of mindless sheep.
------
Honestly, I don't get why belief or lack of belief in something that can't be proven is the deciding factor for someone's eternity. And if you claim it's verifiable, well then other religions could also claim to be verifiable by the same standards. Look at Hinduism, there's a lot of historical evidence supporting the existence of Krishna, or even Mohammed for that matter. And more importantly, not everyone has an equal chance to discover and make this decision. Like those uncontacted tribes in the Amazon, they never had a shot at redemption, plain and simple.

I can't decide what's worse: scenario A where someone makes the wrong choice, or scenario B where someone lives a compassionate, caring, charitable, and peaceful life but still doesn't get full salvation because they lacked a specific belief. 

Also, don't even get me started on the whole "god made himself very visible" argument. Clearly, it's not visible to everyone. What about the people on the other side of the world? What about those who were born just one village too far away to receive the message before they died? Or those who lived before photography even existed? And what about those raised in different faiths who were taught that their beliefs were just as historically relevant?

So, yeah, I think your whole point falls apart when you consider the reality of humanity across the globe. Do these other belief systems still allow for people to access heaven? What about the uncontacted Amazonians or devout Hindus? Can they get in on the salvation action too?
------
Seriously, dude? Are you telling me that giving free shit to lazy people is gonna make our country better? Get real! Why should my hard-earned money go towards feeding some loser's kids when they can't even be bothered to get a job?

And don't even get me started on this whole "welfare" thing. It just breeds a bunch of entitled brats who think they deserve everything handed to them. They should be out there working their asses off like the rest of us, not sitting around watching TV all day.

And as for healthcare, why should I have to pay for someone else's emergency surgery? That's their problem, not mine. They should have planned ahead and saved up for it. It's not my responsibility to bail them out.

You lefties are so damn short-sighted. You think throwing money at problems will magically solve everything. Well, newsflash - it won't. So why don't you stop with your "fix the roof" bullshit and start living in the real world?
------
Honestly, I think those bulk lots are just a waste of money. It's probably just a bunch of useless crap that nobody wants. If your friend wants some actual decent cards, tell him to go for a booster box instead. At least with a booster box, he'll have the excitement of opening up a bunch of packs and he'll have a better chance of getting some good cards.

But hey, if he's not really into playing seriously and just wants quantity over quality, then I guess the bulk lots could be okay. They're probably cheaper anyways. But personally, I'd rather have a few good cards than a whole bunch of garbage. It's up to you though, do whatever floats your boat.
------
Listen, I gotta say, I've had it up to here with people exaggerating Shikamaru's intelligence. Yeah, sure, he's smart and all, but let's not act like he's some goddamn genius. He's just good at playing chess and solving puzzles, big whoop. And don't even get me started on his lazy ass attitude. I mean, seriously? How can someone so lazy be considered a tactical genius? It's laughable. So, yeah, let's stop pretending that Shikamaru is the smartest ninja to ever exist. He's decent, but definitely not on the same level as Itachi or Minato. Can we move on from this overrated hype now?
------
Alright, listen up folks. Look, I get it, I really do. But let's be real here for a sec. Most crime victims, they're not just innocent, they're like aggressively innocent, you know? Take that pizza joint down the street, for example. It's just a freakin' pizza shop! It ain't asking to be caught up in some dangerous situation. It didn't purposely set up shop next to the mafia's hangout spot, for crying out loud. They got a lock on their door and they follow all the regular business protocols. So naturally, we expect their safety to be covered, thanks to their tax dollars and the good ol' boys in blue.

Now, don't get me wrong, I ain't playing the blame game here. Cops gotta step in when folks aren't doing their best to stay safe, even if those folks are straight up evil. But let's face it, it's a bit trickier when we're talking about big corporations knowingly putting themselves in risky situations. They know damn well that Uncle Sam is gonna have to dish out billions to protect their sorry asses, and they're making bank off it too. Doesn't that feel different to you? I mean, if we're using the insurance analogy, ain't their behavior just too damn risky to insure at the usual price? Just sayin'.
------
Man, I just stumbled upon this old interview from 2014 with some third-party developer. And let me tell you, it's a total shitshow. These guys were trying to set up a networking infrastructure to compete with Sony and Microsoft, but turns out they had no clue what they were doing. Can you believe they didn't even bother using Xbox Live or PSN as references? Like, what the actual fuck? They wanted us to explain everything in excruciating detail because apparently their development team had no clue how these systems worked. It's pretty obvious that they were struggling big time and trying to play catch-up without any real experience. I can't even imagine how disastrous their final product must have been. Talk about a major fail.
------
Dude, Sven was a freakin' disaster on TSM. I don't know what they were thinking keeping him around for so long. He was always too damn aggressive and it screwed up their whole team dynamic. Like, Bjerg and the other laners just wanted to chill and farm, but Sven was out there solo diving towers and dying left and right. Talk about boosted.

I gotta admit, though, I was kinda sad to see him finally get the boot. I thought he was starting to fit in better, even though they still sucked at Worlds. But let's be real, TSM ain't making it anywhere near Worlds this year either. Their current gameplay is straight up trash. It's gonna be another disappointment, just you watch.
------
Honestly, what's up with these dumb move restrictions? Like, seriously, why the heck is Fire Lash a signature move for Heatmor? It's not even a physical attacker! Who thought that was a good idea? They should have just given it a better movepool or something. But you know what's even worse? The fact that the elemental punches aren't as strong as the beams. Like, come on! Why can't they just boost the BP on those punches and give that same boost to the fangs? It's not rocket science! And while we're at it, why the hell is it so hard to find good physical electric and fire attacks for quadrupeds? We're stuck with Wild Charge and Flare Blitz and their stupid recoil. Can't they introduce more moves like Icicle Crash? Seriously, game designers, get your act together! *sigh* Rant over.
------
Bruh, are you seriously comparing Wall and Dame? Are you smoking something? Dame drops bombs from downtown like it's nobody's business. Have you seen his 3-point shooting? It's straight fire! And don't even get me started on clutch factor. Dame has ice in his veins, man. Can't say the same for Wall, sorry.

Yeah, sure, Wall may be a better defender and all that, but who cares when Dame is sinking buckets from half-court? Steals per game won't win you games, my dude. It's all about buckets, and Dame is the king of buckets.

And let's talk playoffs. Yeah, Wall talks a big game, but where has he actually taken the Wizards? Nowhere. Dame may have faced the Warriors, the freaking Warriors, twice in the playoffs and got swept last season, but at least he made it to the postseason and put up a fight. Can't say the same for Wall and his crew.

So, don't come at me with this Wall hype, man. Dame is on a whole different level. Put some respect on his name!
------
Honestly, I totally get what you're saying. It's like people are too lazy or too stupid to actually fact-check or think critically about stuff they read on the Internet. And it's not just fake news, it's everything! People just believe whatever aligns with their preconceived notions and can't be bothered to challenge themselves or consider alternative viewpoints. It's like they're living in their own little echo chambers, completely oblivious to reality. And don't even get me started on the trolls and keyboard warriors who spread misinformation just for the hell of it. It's a cesspool out there, and it's only getting worse. But hey, what do I know? I'm just a random redditor ranting on the Internet.
------
Wow, seriously? Are you still living in the Stone Age or something? It's 2022, my friend, and it's about time you catch up with the times. Comparing China to some ancient world power is just plain ridiculous. We live in a modern society where we embrace progress and equality. We don't go around enslaving people or denying rights to women and minorities.

And let's not forget about the whole global market thing. Intellectual property theft is a serious issue that directly harms businesses and innovation. It's not some quaint little disagreement that can be brushed aside.

If you honestly think that the solution to China's rise as a world power is bombing them into submission and pillaging their resources, then you seriously need a reality check. We're better than that, or at least most of us are. Let's focus on finding diplomatic solutions and fostering positive relationships instead of resorting to barbaric tactics.
------
Look, I get it. We all have different priorities and values in relationships. But personally, I couldn't disagree more with your view on sex and sacrifice. Are you seriously saying you would dump someone just because they asked you to give up porn? That's some next-level shit.

I mean, come on! Relationships are about compromise. Sometimes you gotta give up things you like for the sake of your partner's happiness. It's called being considerate and selfless. And yeah, that includes sex too. If my SO asked me to make a sacrifice in the bedroom, I would totally consider it because I care about their satisfaction too.

But hey, if you think it's all about "bodily autonomy" and putting yourself first, go ahead. Live your life the way you want. Just don't complain when you end up lonely and bitter, unable to maintain a healthy relationship. We all have our own views, but yours is just plain selfish in my book.
------
So, here's the deal, I don't have any damn kids, but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy Halloween. I may not go all out like some people in my neighborhood, but I still like to get into the spirit of things. I'll throw up a couple of spooky decorations outside my house just so people don't think I'm a total scrooge.

As for costumes, well, I don't have little brats deciding what I should dress up as. I'll go as whatever the hell I feel like. Last year, I rocked a badass vampire costume and scared the crap out of everyone at the party. It was awesome.

But let's be real here, the best part of Halloween is the free candy. I don't care how old you are, trick or treating never gets old. I'll grab a bag and hit up all the houses in my neighborhood. Who cares if people think I'm too old? Give me that sweet, sweet sugar rush!

So yeah, Halloween is my jam. Kids or no kids, I'm gonna have a wicked good time.
------
So, get this guys. I'm tripping balls with my roommates, having the time of our lives, when suddenly the damn doorbell rings. We all freak the hell out because nobody ever rings our doorbell. Instantly thought it was the freaking cops coming to bust us for our acid shenanigans. So, naturally, we all scatter like scared little bitches and hide. But guess what? These persistent bastards ring the doorbell two more times, like they knew exactly where we were hiding. Finally, I gather up all my courage and open the damn door. And who's standing there? Our smoking hot neighbor, asking about her damn ball that went over our fence. Meanwhile, I'm standing there looking like a hot mess, sweatpants and no shirt, pupils probably the size of saucers. I managed to mumble something about getting the ball, but I have no clue what actually came out of my mouth. After she left, we all creeped to the back room and watched her struggle with the gate, knowing damn well she could see us watching. She finally tossed the ball back over, missed the first time like a total idiot, and had to try again. We could have done it ourselves, but no, we had to make it into a damn acid-induced adventure. And let me tell you, seeing her after that was incredibly awkward, like we were some kind of lunatics. So yeah, that's my "bad trip meets strange neighbor" story. Ended up watching a Pixar movie just to calm our messed-up minds.
------
Okay, so first off, let me just say that I couldn't give two shits about the whole Starkcest thing. Like, seriously, do people really think it's a good idea for Jon to be getting it on with his own family? That's some messed up shit right there.

But anyway, your theory about the warg genes and all that stuff could be interesting, I guess. Maybe the Starks have some sort of special bloodline or something that makes them all magical. Who knows?

As for the kings of winter, who really cares? They're all dead and gone now. Why waste time on ancient history when we've got dragons and White Walkers to worry about? Plus, they were probably just a bunch of power-hungry dudes who liked to play in the snow. Nothing special, if you ask me.

But hey, that's just my two cents. Feel free to disagree or whatever. I'm sure there are plenty of other people out there who actually give a damn about this stuff.
------
Look, I get it. We all have our opinions and we're entitled to them. But seriously, what's with all the drama over here? This whole "innocent until proven guilty" thing is not relevant to this situation. We're not in a courtroom, people! It's just a job interview, for crying out loud.

If someone calls up your potential boss and tells him that you can't keep your hands to yourself or control your impulses, yeah, he's gonna ask questions. And honestly, if you start flipping out and going on these nonsensical rants that no one even cares about, do you really think any competent employer would want to hire you?

Look, there are plenty of other conservative applicants out there who are actually qualified and don't have issues with understanding consent or the word "no." So why don't we just pick one of them and call it a day? It's not about winning or pissing people off, it's about getting a good candidate. Let's focus on that, okay?
------
Yeah, I gotta agree with you there. This dude definitely lacks some serious arm strength. It's like watching a noodle trying to throw a football. But hey, at least he doesn't fall apart when the pressure's on. Instead of taking a damn sack like any normal QB would, he tries to be a hero and make some crazy play. Can't fault him for trying, I guess.

Word on the street is that he's been working on his game though. Now that he finally snagged the starter job, hopefully he'll stop thinking he has to do everything himself. So if you're telling me that the Ravens are gonna sack this Peterman guy like four freakin' times, I'm all in. But honestly, I don't see him replicating that trainwreck of a performance he had against the Chargers.

I'm betting the under against the Ravens, no doubt about it.
------
Okay, seriously? I can't believe you actually think women in those countries can't walk around without a man. Have you even been there? Just because the media loves to exaggerate doesn't mean it's true. I mean, my wife has walked around all four of those countries on her own and guess what, she's still alive! Crazy, right? And she didn't get hassled either. So maybe you should check your facts before spreading this ridiculous fearmongering.

And violence against American women? Come on, give me a break. Sure, bad things happen everywhere, but let's not act like the scale is off the charts. I've been to Dubai myself, and let me tell you, it's safer than some parts of freaking New York City. There are cops all over the place and most people respect women. So maybe stop watching so much Fox News and actually try visiting these places before spreading your ignorant opinions.

Alright, so let me get this straight. You're telling me that you went into a threesome with the intention of having a stable relationship afterwards? Yeah, good luck with that, buddy. I mean, sure, it's your life and your decisions, but personally, I think that's just asking for trouble. And don't even get me started on trying to find advice on how to have a threesome. I mean, seriously, who does that? Shouldn't you figure that out between the people involved? But hey, thanks for sharing your oh-so-enlightening example of having boundaries and discussing beforehand. I'm sure that's groundbreaking information that no one has ever thought of before. Just remember, folks, threesomes aren't for the faint-hearted or those looking for a stable relationship. But hey, you do you. Good luck!

Yo, if you're looking for some more acceleration on your ride, here's a simple trick. Swap out that big-ass sprocket at the front for a smaller one, or if you really wanna go all out, slap on a massive sprocket at the back. And hey, why not do both if you're feeling fancy and replacing everything anyway?

Now, let me break it down for you in plain English. The gear ratio is just the number of teeth on the back sprocket divided by the number of teeth on the front one. Take the legendary R1 for example, it's got 45 teeth at the back and 17 at the front, giving you a ratio of 2.647 (don't worry, math ain't that hard). 

For more acceleration, you wanna increase that ratio. So, let's say you chuck on a 16-tooth sprocket up front and a fat 48-tooth monster at the back. Bam! Your ratio shoots up to 3.000, and you'll be zooming like a bat outta hell. Ride safe, bro!
------
Damn, chill out dude. You're getting all worked up over nothing. So what if this guy has a PhD and has been on some religious board for 30 freaking years? It doesn't mean he's some goddamn genius or that his recommendation is gospel. People make mistakes, you know?

And don't give me that crap about him being more educated and experienced than anyone else on this sub or Reddit. Just because he studied his ass off and kissed enough religious academia board asses doesn't automatically make him the almighty authority on everything.

Look, I get it. You're trying to defend this guy and his recommendation, but you're going about it all wrong. Instead of acting like a sanctimonious prick, why not actually provide some concrete evidence or logical arguments to support your case? Or better yet, just shut the hell up and stop getting so butt hurt over someone not agreeing with you. Jeez.
------
Honestly, I don't get why people are so up in arms about DRM on tractors versus music sharing. It's not the same thing at all. Tractors are physical machines that cost a ton of money to make and maintain, while music is just digital files. I mean, sure, I guess it sucks that you can't lend your neighbor your tractor to mow his field, but that's just the way it is.

But seriously, what's next? Are they gonna start putting DRM on our clothes? Like, will my expensive Kaepernick shoes self-destruct if I don't renew my membership or something? It's ridiculous. And don't even get me started on Monsanto and their GMO corn. They basically DRM'd their crops, and now they're swimming in money while people suffer. It's messed up.

I hope we never have to deal with DRM invading every aspect of our lives. Can you imagine if everything we owned was on some kind of subscription? Ugh, no thanks. Let's hope common sense prevails and we can keep enjoying the things we buy without any restrictions.
------
Wow, seriously? You really need to calm down and get off your high horse. No one said you're worse or below anyone else just because you have a different opinion. But let's be real here, your whole argument is flawed. Yeah sure, some countries may not be big fans of American tourists, but that doesn't prove anything about white supremacy being acceptable everywhere. And what's with this whole "lands being stolen" nonsense? Are we going back to ancient history now? Get over it already.

And come on, don't act like every single thing is about racism. Yeah, people wear costumes in poor taste, so what? Are we gonna cancel Halloween now too? And don't even get me started on these companies and their "questionable things." Newsflash, buddy, that's just how the world works. If you wanna live in a perfect little bubble where everyone is pure and innocent, good luck with that. The real fight should be against the actual crimes against humanity, instead of wasting time dividing people over this race crap.

So yeah, take your self-righteous attitude somewhere else. Nobody's supporting the KKK, and nobody needs your lecture on morality.
------
Honestly, I don't get why people are still so obsessed with the whole Stark and "the north" crap. Sure, it's cool and all with the magical stuff and whatnot, but come on, we've had like eight seasons of this show and they still haven't explained half of it. And now we're supposed to wait for the books to maybe give us some answers? Yeah, like that's ever gonna happen. 

But hey, if you're into all that mystery stuff, good for you. I guess it's nice to have something to speculate about while we're waiting for George R.R. Martin to finish a damn book. Personally, I couldn't care less about the whole age of heroes or the others or whatever the hell is going on up there. Just give me some epic battles and dragon action, and I'll be happy. Anyone else feel the same way?
------
Yo, fellow vapers! Just wanted to share my modding experience with the Pulse. I totally pimped mine out with a sick flat plate push connector to fix that annoying voltage drop issue. Trust me, it's a game-changer!

Speaking of squonk mechs, my all-time favorite is the Box Mod Mafia The Punk. It's a stealthy little beast that hits like a truck. And let me tell you, it's probably smaller than the Athena (can't compare since I don't have one, though).

Now, onto some real talk. The Rage is dope, no doubt. But I've come across some scary-ass horror stories about it. Like, who wants their mod turning into a horror movie, right?

On the other hand, the Basium seems solid. Haven't seen any major negatives except for its looks. But hey, beauty is subjective, am I right?

If I had some extra cash lying around, I'd totally go for the Vicious Ant Space 21700 with DNA 75C. That thing is straight-up luxury vaping. It's like the Rolls-Royce of mods, baby.

All in all, these are just my two cents. Vape on, bros and broettes!
------
I mean, come on, have you seen some of these new young adult series? They're just a hot mess. And don't even get me started on Percy Jackson and Eragon. How in the world did those books make so much money when they're so poorly written? It boggles my mind. It's like the publishers just jumped on the bandwagon after J.K. Rowling struck gold with Harry Potter. Sure, there were good YA books back in the day, like The Chronicles of Narnia and Wrinkle in Time, but nowadays it's all hit or miss. I guess you could say J.K. Rowling started a YA renaissance, but it's a double-edged sword. We got some decent stuff out of it like A Series of Unfortunate Events, but for every good one, there are three terrible ones. It's like the quality control went out the window.
------
Hey, so I was reading your post and gotta say, it's great that you're being supportive of your friend. But seriously, why are you asking random internet strangers about the soreness after a medical procedure? Just ask your friend or, I don't know, maybe the doctor who's actually doing it? It's kinda weird to go around Reddit asking about personal stuff like this. And FYI, I highly doubt anyone here can give you a definitive answer anyway. As for the financial support, that's awesome! But maybe instead of making a post about it on Reddit, you could just, I don't know, start a GoFundMe or something? Just saying, you might get better results there. Good luck, though!
------
Yeah, I totally get your skepticism about Diablo 2 remastered. Blizzard has been all about this money-grabbing BS lately. It's like they don't care about making great games anymore, they just want to milk us for every penny. Starcraft remastered made sense because it's still a big esport, but with D2 remastered, it's just gonna be a one-time purchase with no way for them to squeeze more cash out of us. Unless they come up with some kind of DLC or microtransactions, but let's be real, they'll probably save that shit for Diablo 3. Ugh, it's sad to see a company that used to be so awesome turn into greedy assholes.
------
I don't get why people are making such a big deal out of this. So what if they're saying that medical weed should be traded globally? Who cares about the schedule and all that crap? Just let the market sort it out, man. Quality? Well, I guess that's up to the buyers to decide, right? But seriously, why does there have to be some big "evolution" of the single convention on drugs before we can start selling medical ganja everywhere? It's just a bunch of politicians trying to make themselves look important. I'm glad to see that international commerce for weed is finally opening up, though. It's about damn time. Good news indeed.
------
Hey, if your PS4 is connected to the TP-Link router, it's stuck behind a double NAT setup. Not good, my dude. Since you can access the port forwarding settings on the Calix router, I suggest you convert that TP-Link into an Access Point (AP) following my super simple instructions.

Once you've done that, you need to make sure all the devices connected to the TP-Link get new IP addresses. Just reboot them or disconnect and reconnect them from the network, and they should grab IP addresses from the subnet provided by the Calix. Easy peasy, right?

Now go ahead and set up that sweet port forwarding or enable UPnP on the Calix, if that's your jam. Time to get your PS4 unleashed and ready for some serious gaming! Good luck, my fellow Redditor!
------
Yeah, I totally agree with you. People need to stop playing the victim card and blaming China for everything. It's not bullying if the US lets Chinese companies sell their stuff on US soil. That's just capitalism at work, my friend. And let's not forget how the US has done some pretty messed up stuff in the past. Remember the whole war for bananas thing? Yeah, that's the kind of crazy stuff the US is capable of. So don't go crying about being bullied by China when it's really just the US being all capitalist and stuff.

And don't even get me started on Trump's trade wars. Like seriously, do people actually think that's gonna fix anything? Spoiler alert: it won't. It's just making things worse. The real solution here is getting money out of politics. The two-party system is a joke, man. The founding fathers even said so, but hey, we're stuck with it. So whatever side you're on, just rally behind getting money out of politics.

But seriously, stop with the whole "poor little America being bullied" mindset. It's just pathetic.
------
Dude, you're totally missing the point here. Raising the minimum wage ain't gonna do squat for Gary Indiana or any other place for that matter. It's all about those greedy corporations screwing everyone over. They've got their grubby hands in everything these days, owning businesses left and right. And you think they're just gonna sit back and take a hit to their profits? Hell no!

Sure, the wages for low-income workers might come from these out-of-state company coffers, but that's not gonna change with a higher minimum wage. Those companies will just find a way to cut costs and screw over the workers even more. It's always the little guys who suffer.

So, don't be fooled by this whole minimum wage hype. It's just a distraction from the real problem – corporate greed. We need to focus on holding these big shots accountable and fighting for fair wages and worker rights. Only then will we see any real change.
------
Wow, dude, I don't even know where to start with your comment. Can you please learn how to express your thoughts without being a total jerk? It's not cool. 

First of all, your language is completely inappropriate. It's not just about sexual penetration, it's about consent and boundaries. If Kavanaugh did what those women have accused him of, then it's a serious problem regardless of the specific details. 

And let's not forget that these are allegations, not facts. We should take them seriously and investigate them thoroughly. The lack of evidence doesn't automatically mean they didn't happen. That's why an investigation is necessary.

And by the way, it's not the FBI's job to investigate this. It's the Senate's responsibility to conduct hearings and gather evidence. Get your facts straight, man.

And finally, I never said she denied being in front of Congress. I said she was reluctant. And now she's willing to testify. Get your reading comprehension up, bro.

Oh, and thanks for the info about Maryland's statute of limitations, but that seems kinda irrelevant right now. Let's focus on the allegations and the investigation instead, okay?
------
Man, I can't believe there are still people out there who call themselves "libertarians" but support guys like Gary Johnson and Ron Paul. Like seriously, do they even know what being a libertarian means? These so-called "libertarians" are actually just anarcho-capitalists, or ancaps, and they think the free market can solve everything. Talk about living in a dream world.

But you know who really gets it? Libertarian socialists. These guys understand that individual freedom has its limits when it starts messing with other people's lives. They get that we need a strong social safety net to help those in need and promote social mobility. And guess what? They also understand that being tied to a job you hate just to survive is no way to live. They know that true entrepreneurship comes from a place of freedom, not desperation.

So yeah, to all those "libertarians" out there supporting Gary Johnson and Ron Paul, you might want to reevaluate your beliefs. The real libertarians are the ones fighting for a society where we can all achieve more together.
------
Alright, here's my informal and impolite post on a new thread:

> Seriously, what the hell is wrong with people? I mean, come on, it's not rocket science to figure out how to communicate with others. If you're living in a country where the majority speaks a certain language, it's just common sense to learn it or at least make an effort. I don't get why some people think they can just waltz into a foreign country and not give a damn about the language. It's called respect, people!
> 
> And this whole situation, like, seriously? The employee clearly knew what was going on and chose to be a total jerk. Good thing they got their sorry ass fired. Can't stand these entitled morons who think they can do whatever the hell they want without facing consequences. I hope they learned their lesson.
> 
> Honestly, I feel bad for the customers in this situation. They were just trying to get some damn service, and they had to deal with this nonsense. People need to grow the hell up and start acting like decent human beings. End of rant.
------
Ugh, seriously? Who cares about all this pointless lore crap? Like, yeah, I get that it's supposed to give more background and stuff, but it's not even considered part of the show canon. It's just some extra info from the books that they throw in to confuse us show watchers even more. And don't even get me started on that Jeyne Pool nonsense. Like, why would they waste their time making a lore video about a character that doesn't even exist in the show? It's just sloppy writing, if you ask me.

And let's be real here, if it's not mentioned in the actual show, it ain't show cannon. Simple as that. That stupid lore video was made way back in season two when the show was still trying to be faithful to the books. But now it's just become its own thing, so who even cares about what's in those outdated videos anymore? Can we please focus on the actual show and stop wasting our time with this irrelevant lore garbage?
------
Hey, listen up. I gotta say, your post is a complete mess. First of all, who the hell cares about what disorder she has? Bulimia, binge eating disorder, or whatever, they're all messed up. They all need professional help, that's for damn sure. So quit playing armchair psychologist and just tell her to get her ass to a therapist already.

And seriously, dude, simmer down with your anger. Who do you think you are, holding onto all that crap? It's obviously not doing you any good. Just grow a pair and have a freakin' conversation with her. Yeah, it might suck, but guess what? That's called being an adult. Bottling up your feelings and complaining on Reddit won't solve anything. So stop being a whiny little baby and deal with it like a grown-up.

Bottom line, none of this is healthy, for either of you. So stop wasting time on the internet and go have a real conversation. And maybe lay off the junk food while you're at it. Geez.
------
Wow, really? You honestly believe that? I mean, come on, get off your high horse and open your eyes to the real world. Just because you know a few people who had some tough experiences with healthcare doesn't mean it's some kind of widespread catastrophe. You act like everyone is out here dying because they can't afford medical treatment. News flash, buddy, most people manage just fine. Maybe instead of playing the victim card, you should take some personal responsibility and plan ahead for life's unexpected curveballs. Don't expect everyone else to foot the bill for your poor choices or lack of preparedness. So quit whining and try seeing things from a different perspective for once.
------
Wow, thanks for the super technical explanation! As a casual Redditor, I have absolutely no idea what you just said. All I got was "optimization" and "code bloat." Can you please explain it in normal people terms? Like, what does all this linking and visibility stuff even mean? And why should I care about a smaller binary? Does it mean my computer will run faster or something? Sorry for being a total noob here, but I just want to understand what you're talking about. Thanks!
------
Yeah, it's crazy how backward some places can be when it comes to weed. Like seriously, can we all just chill out and let people do their thing? It's not hurting anyone. But oh no, we still have these Bible Belt states stuck in the Stone Age, still thinking it's the devil's lettuce or some shit. Give me a break. Thankfully though, things are slowly changing. I mean, look at how many states have legalized it already. It's about damn time. So yeah, while there are still some places where you have to watch your back and be careful who you talk to about it, overall we've come a long way. Let's keep pushing for that progress and hopefully one day we won't have to worry about this nonsense anymore. Peace out, fellow ents!
------
Man, it's unbelievable how people can be so damn reckless when it comes to road safety. Like seriously, what the hell is wrong with some pedestrians out there? It's like they think they're invincible or something. I mean, why the hell would you even think it's a good idea to cross a busy road without a freaking crosswalk? Are you trying to get yourself killed?

But it's not just the pedestrians who are at fault here. Bad driving is just as big of a problem. I swear, some of these idiots behind the wheel shouldn't even be allowed to drive in the first place. Thank god for all those fancy car features like auto braking and blind spot monitoring because clearly, we need them to compensate for all the dumbasses on the road.

And don't even get me started on Baltimore. Those people have a serious death wish or something. They just step right out in front of you like they own the damn road. It's infuriating!

I've seen it firsthand, man. Knew this girl who ran a freaking stop sign on her little scooter and got plowed by a freaking truck on Route 1. Tragic, but hey, maybe it's natural selection at work.

Anyway, sorry for the rant. Just had to get this off my chest. Stay safe out there, folks. Drive responsibly, and pedestrians, seriously, use some common sense!
------
Dude, seriously? You're asking where else small businesses can advertise? Have you been living under a rock? How about trying Google Ads or actual freaking websites? Email is so 2005, man. Nobody wants to get bombarded with spammy newsletters from businesses they don't care about. And clipboard signups? Are you kidding me? Who's gonna waste their time signing up for some random crap at a bar? People just want to enjoy their drinks, not be bothered by your self-promotion. If you're too lazy to put in the effort to market your business properly, then maybe you shouldn't be in business at all. Do some research, dude, and stop relying on outdated methods.
------
Damn, are you serious? You really think Sarada is some overpowered badass ninja? Get real, man! All she's got is a measly one-tomoe Sharingan and some basic ass lightning jutsu. And don't even get me started on that fireball jutsu. That's like Uchiha 101, nothing special there.

And you know what really grinds my gears? You claim to like Sarada but then talk all this shit about her character. It's like you can't handle the fact that people actually find her interesting. And don't even get me started on those whiny threads on Narutoforums, crying about people liking her. Like seriously, grow a pair.

Oh, and just wait till you say one bad word about Boruto. Suddenly, it's "hate this" and "hate that." Give me a break. Can't we all just have our own opinions without getting our panties in a twist? SMH.
------
Honestly, I don't get why people are making such a big fuss about this whole Nike protest thing. It's not like anyone would give a crap about Kaepernick if the lefties didn't keep bringing him up all the time. And let's be real, if he didn't try to become some sort of civil rights hero and score a fat ad deal with Nike, no one would even bother protesting. So, yeah, I think it's fair game to criticize him when he's constantly in the spotlight. It's not like these protesters just randomly decided to hate on him for no reason. He brought it upon himself. Sacrificing everything? Please, spare me the dramatics. Dude made a freaking fortune out of this whole ordeal. So can we all just move on already and stop acting like Kaepernick is some saint or whatever?
------
Man, let me tell you, Ashran was a total snooze fest. I mean, seriously, it was about as exciting as watching paint dry. And don't even get me started on the gear grind. It was like the only way to get decent gear was to suffer through that mind-numbingly boring crap. Both factions were just avoiding each other and doing these stupid PvE quests. Like, come on, where's the fun in that? And to top it all off, they made it mandatory for fresh characters. Like, what the hell were they thinking? I had friends who straight up quit because of that garbage. It gave them such a crappy impression of WoW that they didn't even want to bother with raids, mythics, or arenas. Can you blame them though? Ashran was a straight-up dumpster fire.
------
Yo, what's up with all this Russia hate? I mean, come on, who are we to talk about international norms? Like, have you seen what the US has been up to? Overthrowing governments left and right, ignoring international laws, and using NATO as their personal army. And don't even get me started on the whole empire and hegemony thing.

International norms my ass. It's just a fancy term for maintaining their power and control. We should be pushing for a multipolar world, where no one country calls all the shots. So before you go bashing Russia, maybe take a look at your own backyard, buddy. Peace!
------
Yeah, I totally get what you're saying. It's like, why is supporting minority groups such a bad thing? I mean, come on, the conservative parties in Canada are all about that intolerance crap. They can't even pretend to be nice to immigrants because their base hates them so much. It's like they don't even want to try to appeal to anyone who's not white and straight. If they actually cared about getting votes, they would do whatever it takes to woo the immigrant and diversity vote, just like the left does. But nah, their supporters are too busy being hateful and intolerant, so they'll never be a real political party.
------
Man, this is such a freaking common problem in mid-size cities, especially in the freaking industrial midwest. Back in the day, these places were bumpin' with a few factories, usually just sticking to one damn industry. But then, as the damn economy shifted to some fancy-ass white-collar service shit in the late 20th century, all the job growth started happening in big cities, leaving these mid-size cities in a real shitty spot.

I personally grew up in good ol' NE Ohio, and let me tell ya, I saw this crap happenin' in cities like Canton, Steubenville, and Erie. The young folks, including myself, hightailed it outta there and headed to bigger cities like Cleveland, Pittsburgh, or even the damn coast, where there were actually decent opportunities.

Honestly, it's just a sad state of affairs for these forgotten cities. It's like they got left in the dust while the rest of the world moved on.
------
Hey, look, I get that you have some opinions, but can we please have a civil discussion here? Your post is filled with generalizations and assumptions that aren't helpful or productive. Yes, there are issues within every community, including the black community, but that doesn't mean we should only focus on blaming them. The point of the Black Lives Matter movement is to address systemic biases and injustices in the criminal justice system. It's not about dividing or blaming anyone. And no, supporting BLM is definitely not the same as supporting the KKK, that's just a ridiculous comparison. Can we try to have a constructive conversation instead of throwing out wild accusations and spreading misinformation?
------
I mean, seriously? Dental tourism? Are people actually dumb enough to think that's a good idea? Going all the way to Mexico just to save a few bucks on dental work? Yeah, sure, let's trust some random dentist in a foreign country with our precious teeth. What could possibly go wrong?

And don't even get me started on the whole "can't sue them" thing. Like, really? They know they can get away with botching someone's mouth because it's not like you're gonna hop on a plane back there just to fix it. And good luck finding an American dentist who's willing to touch that mess.

It's just ridiculous how everyone in this chain is promoting dental tourism like it's some kind of miracle solution. If you want something done right, go to a trusted local dentist and stop falling for these scams. Seriously, people need to wake up and realize that dental tourism is a disaster waiting to happen.
------
Yeah, I totally get what you're saying. It's so frustrating how people just jump to conclusions without knowing the full story. Like seriously, just because a few dumbasses can't handle a mechanical mod doesn't mean the whole damn vaping community is to blame. It's like blaming all car owners for a few accidents caused by reckless drivers.

And don't even get me started on the media. They're always looking for the next big scaremongering headline. "Epidemic of teen vaping"? Give me a break! It's not like every high schooler out there is puffing on a vape like it's their lifeline.

People need to chill the fuck out and stop demonizing everything they don't understand. Vaping has helped countless smokers quit and improve their lives. But of course, those success stories don't make juicy headlines, do they? Ugh, it just pisses me off.
------
Seriously, who cares about all these unnecessary details? The whole Han and Chewie backstory is completely irrelevant. Like, we already knew they were bros from the original trilogy, so why do we need to know that they first met when Chewie was trying to off Han on some random battlefield? That doesn't add anything to their relationship. And don't even get me started on this whole "sentient being trapped inside the Falcon" nonsense. It just ruins the legacy of the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. Han being a good guy from the start? Boring! We loved him for being a rogue smuggler with a heart of gold. And let's not forget Lando. All we learned is that he had a fling with a droid and has a fashion obsession with capes. Big whoop! Solo is just a useless addition to the franchise. It changes squat and means nothing to the overall story. Can we please move on to something that actually matters?
------
Man, I gotta say, it's ridiculous how people on this damn site can't even have a civil conversation without resorting to name-calling and dehumanizing each other. Like seriously, there's no need to call someone "subhuman trash" just because they have a different political opinion. It's not like that has anything to do with the topic at hand, you know?

But hey, here's a thought for you all: there was this black dude who actually saw the humanity in KKK members. Yeah, you heard me right. He looked past their racist bullshit and treated them like human beings. And you know what? It actually worked. He changed their minds and proved them wrong.

So maybe, just maybe, instead of hurling insults and acting all high and mighty, we could try seeing the humanity in each other too. We might actually make some progress and not give those bigots any more excuses to justify their messed up beliefs. Just saying.
------
Yo, let me tell you something about the fashion industry. It's a freakin' risky business, especially for those designers trying to make it big. Like, they can't even figure out if people gonna like their new designs or styles. And that's why these fast fashion brands like Express can sell clothes for dirt cheap. They just copy the successful high fashion stuff and pump out a ton of it. That way they're reducing their risk and selling more, which means lower prices for us.

But here's the thing, if fancy-pants brands like Burberry don't have enough stock available, they can't cash in on their successful items. And if they start making fewer clothes overall, they gotta jack up the prices. And you know what happens then? People start running away, man. They can't afford that expensive stuff anymore, and those brands end up losing their main customers. So yeah, it's a tough game they're playing.
------
lol who cares about gay pride parades? Like seriously, get over yourselves. I mean, sure, there's progress being made legally, but we don't need these over-the-top celebrations. It's not like being gay is some special achievement or something. And let's be real, these parades are just an excuse for people to party and show off their rainbow outfits. I mean, come on! There are more important things to focus on, like suicide rates among LGBTQ+ folks. Instead of wasting time and energy on parades, why don't we try actually addressing the issues that matter? Being gay shouldn't define a person or be a reason to throw a huge festival. It's just ridiculous and attention-seeking if you ask me.
------
1. Dude, seriously? You're gonna start off your post with some condescending lecture about how this ain't a "free" country? Spare me the political science lesson, bro. We all know we have laws and stuff, but that doesn't mean we can't talk about the things that limit our freedom or debate what's right and wrong. So chill with the textbook definitions, man.

2. Hunting? Who even brought up hunting? This thread ain't about hunting. Stay on topic, dude. It's like you're trying to derail the whole conversation. Can we just stick to the point here?

3. Ugh, dude, are you seriously comparing getting hit by a bullet to getting struck by lightning? That's just apples and oranges, man. They're both bad, no doubt, but they're completely different things. Can we stop with these random comparisons and actually focus on the issue at hand?

4. Less guns means less gun deaths? Yeah, maybe in theory, but do you have any actual evidence to back that up? 'Cause it sounds like you're just spouting some anti-gun propaganda. And why the heck are you bringing up suicides and accidents? We're talking about intentional shootings here. Stick to the topic, man. And if you wanna bring up stats, let's see some real numbers, not just your opinions. Show me the facts, bro.
------
Hey, just wanted to point out that your claim about deaf people experiencing auditory hallucinations is not entirely accurate. While some deaf individuals may indeed experience visual hallucinations related to communication, the article you shared also states that deaf people who were born without hearing do not actually experience true auditory hallucinations. 

It's important to make this distinction because implying that all deaf individuals can hear through hallucinations may lead to misunderstandings. Being born deaf means that they have never had the neural connections necessary to perceive sound, so it's unlikely for them to have auditory hallucinations.

I wanted to clarify this because your statement seems misleading and might give the wrong impression to others. It's always good to provide accurate information, especially when discussing sensitive topics like this.

Dude, I totally get where you're coming from. My wife and I were in the same freakin' boat a couple of years ago, debating whether to buy a damn house or not. We were sweating our asses off, worrying about this so-called housing crash everyone was babbling about. But you know what? Screw it! Some wise soul told me to stop overthinking it and just go for it if we could handle the financial burden, even if the freakin' interest rates soar. And guess what? We did it, man!

Let me tell you, owning a house beats the crap out of renting. No more dealing with lousy landlords or wasting our hard-earned cash on their greedy asses. It's frickin' liberating, bro! Plus, like everyone else is saying, Maitland is booming like crazy, so chances are those property values will keep skyrocketing.

So my advice to you, dude, is to quit being a worrywart and take the plunge. If you can handle a bit of a rate hike without sh*tting your pants, go all in and become a homeowner, baby! You won't regret it. Trust me, I've been there. Good luck, man!

Yo, this subreddit is a total shitshow. As a wannabe sociologist, I can't help but marvel at how messed up things are right now. I mean, have you seen all the Russian propaganda floating around? It's mind-boggling to see how easily people get influenced by that crap. And let's not forget those racist assholes shooting innocent Indians in bars just because they feel threatened. Or those KKK members running folks over like it's some sick game. Oh, and don't even get me started on the morons trying to shoot up pizza joints that don't have a damn basement! Seriously, what's wrong with people? And now we got idiots taking over the Hoover Dam in the name of some Q nonsense. It's batshit insane, man. And the scariest part is that there are actually a lot of dumbasses out there who buy into this garbage. Yeah, sure, only a few act out, but way too many believe this crap. Society is going down the drain, my friends.
------
Dude, seriously? Are you defending Kavanaugh right now? Like, come on! It's not about the presumption of innocence and all that crap. It's about a woman coming forward and sharing her story. It takes so much courage to do that, and you're just dismissing it like it's nothing.

And don't even get me started on your "changing of the story" argument. People remember things differently over time, especially traumatic events. Does that mean they're lying? No, it means they're human.

And yeah, maybe the witness denies ever knowing him. But let me ask you something: If your friend was accused of something terrible, would you really admit to knowing them? I highly doubt it.

You're missing the whole point here, man. These allegations may be from 40 years ago, but they still matter. They still deserve to be taken seriously. False accusations are serious, yes, but so is sexual assault. And by downplaying this whole thing, you're just proving why victims are afraid to come forward.

Think about that before you start defending the indefensible.

Honestly, it's ridiculous how people can be so ignorant and judgmental about mental illness. Like, seriously, do they think we just enjoy feeling like crap all the time? Newsflash: it's not a freaking choice. It's a freaking illness.

I'm so sick of people saying things like "just think positive" or "snap out of it". Oh yeah, because it's so easy to just magically make your brain chemistry go back to normal, right? Give me a break. Mental illness is real, it's debilitating, and it's not something we can just wish away.

And let's not even get started on the stigma surrounding it. People act like having a mental illness automatically makes you some kind of psycho or a danger to society. Well, guess what? Most of us are just trying to survive and get through each day, just like everyone else.

So next time someone tries to tell you that mental illness is all in your head or that you should just suck it up, feel free to tell them to shove it. They clearly have no clue what they're talking about.
------
Okay, listen up folks. I can't believe I have to explain this, but here goes nothing. Some of you idiots need to understand that just because you have an opinion, it doesn't magically transform into a fact. Seriously, buddy, did you miss the memo on that?

I mean, come on! This dude claims that circumcision is always an upgrade to the male anatomy. Newsflash, genius, that's not true for everyone. People have different experiences and preferences, in case you haven't noticed. Just because you think it's beneficial doesn't mean it applies to everybody. Get off your high horse and face reality!

I've seen comments from people who regret being cut, feeling hopeless and mocked. Why would you want that for your own kid? Are you deliberately trying to screw up their life? It's mind-boggling how some of you can be so dense and ignore all the evidence that contradicts your belief.

The bottom line is, if you can't back up your claim with something credible, then maybe you should keep your misguided opinions to yourself. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk. Peace out!
------
Yo, did you guys know that the whole separation of church and state thing ain't actually in the constitution? Yeah, it's true. Some people just interpreted some fancy language in the first amendment to mean that. One of the OG interpretations was this letter from Thomas Jefferson talking about a wall between the two. But let me tell ya, there are conflicting interpretations out there, even in the courts. 

Personally, I think kids shouldn't have to say that damn pledge at all, especially with all that god stuff in there. Like seriously, why do we gotta keep pushing this religious agenda on everyone? Back in the day, during the cold war and all, religion was a way for us to show we were better than them godless commies. So, we started slapping references to god everywhere, like on our money and in schools. It's all about tolerance, my dudes. We gotta be more open-minded.
------
Dude, not all municipals are tax-free, man. Like those build america bonds, they're usually taxable. It's only a small part of the huge municipal debt market, which is like, $4 trillion! That's almost half the frickin' mortgage debt, bro.

But here's the thing, right? The big players in tax-free munis are banks and insurance companies. If a bunch of defaults or major reductions happen, it would mess up those markets real bad. It's like dominos falling again, just like 2008. And guess what? The government will have to step in and choose who gets saved and who gets screwed. That's why this crap is more about politics than economics, my dude.
------
I mean, seriously, what's the big deal? It looks fine to me. Who cares if there's some tiny little imperfection? Not everyone has to be an expert on tattoos and analyze every little detail. Can't we just appreciate the art and let people enjoy their ink without nitpicking? And this whole blowout thing, I don't see it at all. Maybe it's because I'm not a tattoo fanatic or something, but come on, dude, I've been staring at this picture for like five minutes and I still don't see what you're talking about. Most normal people wouldn't either. So why don't you quit being so picky and just enjoy the damn tattoo like the rest of us?
------
Damn, can we talk about the MCU and how it loves to take a big ol' dump on the comics? I mean, seriously, Ragnarok? More like "Ragnawhack!" Let's be real here, it's just like those garbage movies BvS and GotG, where the directors are all like, "Screw the source material, this is MY vision." It's a slap in the face to all the comic book fans out there.

And don't even get me started on you MCU fanboys. So quick to defend your precious franchise. I didn't even say anything bad about it! But let's face it, Ragnarok isn't faithful to the comics at all. Have any of you even cracked open a single panel of Ragnarok? Didn't think so. Balder? Yeah, forget about him. They just conveniently left his ass out.

But hey, I'll give credit where it's due. Ragnarok is still a great movie, despite its blatant disregard for the source material. So yeah, keep on defending your precious MCU, little fanboys. I'll be over here, actually reading the damn comics. Mic drop.
------
Yo, what a freaking disaster! I can't even imagine the mess you're dealing with, man. 83,000 pictures and 247 GB? Holy crap. And thousands of duplicates on top of that? It's like a digital nightmare.

But hey, props to you for actually taking the time and effort to sort through all that shit. Nine whole days? That's dedication right there. And it's impressive that Duplicate Detective didn't crash on you, even when your mom went and closed your laptop like a clueless idiot. Classic mom move, am I right?

Anyway, good job on deleting those 38,000 duplicate files. That's gotta feel like a weight off your shoulders. And now you're onto organizing all that chaos in Lightroom? Damn, you're a glutton for punishment, my friend.

Just wanted to say props to this subreddit for helping you out. Seriously, the support you got from people all over the world is freaking mind-blowing. Who would've thought Reddit could be such a freaking miracle?

So yeah, congrats on surviving this dumpster fire shitshow, dude. You're a legend in my book. Keep on keepin' on!
------
Seriously, who cares about preserving a "pure, un-bastardized version" of a language? I mean, come on, languages are meant to evolve and change over time. Can you imagine if we never borrowed words from other languages? English would be so boring and limited. And let's not forget that French itself has borrowed plenty of words from other languages in the past. So why all the fuss now?

I get it, some people are nostalgic and want to hold on to the past. But let's be realistic here, language preservation laws just seem like a waste of time and resources. There are way more important things to worry about in the world than whether or not we use loan-words. Plus, who gets to decide what counts as a loan-word? Are we going to start banning words like "croissant" or "rendezvous" because they're not "pure" enough? Give me a break.

Languages should be dynamic and reflect the ever-changing societies we live in. So, to those who believe in these language preservation laws, I say loosen up and embrace the beautiful chaos of linguistic evolution.
------
Wow, I can't believe people actually use "free will" in such a ridiculous way. I mean, seriously? Who even came up with this nonsense? It's like they're trying to complicate things just for the sake of it. I always thought the definition of free will was pretty straightforward - doing whatever the hell you want without anyone or anything stopping you. But now they want to redefine it so that we can still have these pointless debates? Give me a break! Can't we just stick to the good old definition that makes sense to everyone? It's not rocket science, people! Let's stop overthinking things and get back to using common sense, shall we?
------
Hey, can we take a moment to talk about Booker? Honestly, that guy is the friggin' man. No doubt about it. But you know what's even better? This move he just pulled is a total win-win for him politically. He saw all the love and attention Harris was getting yesterday, and he straight-up stole that thunder like a boss. Now he's put himself right smack in the middle of the Democrat resistance. Talk about strategic.

And here's the kicker: imagine if he actually gets kicked out of the senate. That means he'll have 100% of his time to campaign. Boom! He can totally play the "I sacrificed everything for the country" card and use it to his advantage as the future President. Mad respect, my dude. Takes some serious cajones to make a move like this. Just wanted to share a different perspective, you know?
------
Man, Serena's argument just totally falls apart when she starts spewing crap like "you will never be on my court again" and demanding an apology. Seriously, who does she think she is? In any other sport, if a dude said that kind of stuff to a ref, he'd be disciplined or booted out of the game in a heartbeat. I've been watching sports for 25 damn years, and I've never heard a male athlete act like such a entitled brat. Umpires would toss you in baseball, basketball refs would slap you with technical fouls, and soccer refs would flash red cards for dissent. It's absurd that she believes she's in this supreme position of power.

Let's get real here, her outburst was worse than just calling the call bullshit or cursing. There's a difference between expressing your frustration with a call and straight up attacking the official personally. She basically said he's a thief and demanded an apology. That's not questioning a call, that's attacking someone's character and undermining their authority.
------
i mean, come on guys, let's be real here. blizzard knows damn well that if they start hyping up something big and then only drop a few measly things like an animated series and a stupid switch port, people are gonna lose their minds. like seriously, who cares about that stuff? we want the good stuff, we want Diablo 4. 

and you know what? i can feel it in my bones, man. Diablo 4 is definitely coming. blizzard ain't stupid enough to tease us like this without having something huge up their sleeves. they know they'd get so much hate if they didn't deliver after giving all these signs. so yeah, mark my words, Diablo 4 is on its way. and if it's not, well, they better prepare for the backlash of a lifetime.
------
Hey, I think you're missing the point here. Just because something lasted a long time doesn't mean it's automatically good or valuable. Look at the Kardashians, they've been around for years and I wouldn't call them a great contribution to society.

And don't even get me started on the Catholic Church. Yeah, sure, they've been around for centuries, but let's not forget about all the corruption, scandals, and abuse that they've been involved in. Just because they have a unified doctrine doesn't mean it's a good thing. It's more like brainwashing if you ask me.

So, no, Christianity is not some magical stable force. It's caused plenty of problems throughout history. Open your eyes, man, and stop blindly defending something just because it's been around for a long time.
------
I mean, seriously, who even cares why Argentina is feminine? Like, does it really matter? Can't we just accept that languages are weird and move on with our lives? It's not like knowing the reason is gonna change anything. And why are we even discussing this in the first place? There are way more interesting things to talk about, like why pineapple on pizza is a crime against humanity or why cats are so damn obsessed with cardboard boxes. Let's save ourselves the trouble of trying to understand the intricacies of Spanish grammar and focus on the important stuff, like whether aliens exist or if Netflix will ever bring back Firefly. Priorities, people!
------
Okay, seriously guys, can we just take a moment to talk about this whole Kavanaugh situation? I mean, come on, the only reason I don't give a damn about Garland is because Obama never bothered to put forth another nomination. And guess what? I fully expect Trump to do the same if Kavanaugh falls through. But no, the leftists out there have this ridiculous idea that Mueller's takedown will somehow be thwarted by the Supreme Court. Like, what? Are they playing some kind of short game strategy here? Newsflash, people, this shit is all about the long game for us. And let me tell you, my state is trying to pass this bill that would make us worse than California. So yeah, I want the Supreme Court to start taking these cases seriously and actually do something when these crazy bills succeed. Sorry for the rant, but this stuff really gets to me.
------
So, get this. I'm sitting in my stupid Spanish class, and the teacher assigns us this dumb persuasive essay about whether bullfighting should be allowed in Spain. Can you believe that crap? Anyway, I decide to play along and write this whole essay about how it's some important tradition and part of Spain's precious national identity or whatever. And you won't believe what happens next.

This clueless professor pulls me aside after class and starts gushing about how happy she is that I "understand" how crucial this barbaric "sport" is to the country. Seriously, lady? I almost burst out laughing right then and there. Like, do I really look like I buy into this crap? But hey, I didn't have the heart to tell her that my whole essay was a load of BS because I couldn't figure out how to argue my real opinion (which is obviously that it's straight up animal cruelty) in freaking Spanish. Ugh, the things we do to pass a stupid class.
------
Wow, thanks for sharing those statistics! They're like gold to me! But what I meant by saying "we don't have the data I need" is because most of the numbskulls in my office play this game where they only look at the damn police reports and try to help the dumbasses involved. So if these macho dudes don't bother reaching out about their domestic violence situations (which they rarely do, sadly), we can't do jack shit to help them because I don't have their damn data. I work in this godforsaken area that's practically a crime hotspot. It's like one of the trashiest places in the whole country, seriously. Domestic violence is off the charts here, right after freaking murder! Yeah, mostly it's women being targeted, but if these clueless men started reporting, our crappy reports would go through the roof.
------
Are you fucking serious right now? How the hell is she being unprofessional? You must be blind if you can't see the blatant harassment she's facing. And don't even get me started on your assumption about men not understanding why women don't speak up. Talk about generalizing! 

Did you even read her post properly? She didn't say a single thing about her work, yet you're here fantasizing about her getting disciplined by HR. Get your sick mind out of the gutter, buddy. I'm glad her update clarified that those assholes who sent her those disgusting messages are the ones facing consequences. That's called justice, in case you're unfamiliar with the concept.

If anything, she's going to be known as the badass professional woman who stands up for herself and keeps evidence. So, take your misogyny elsewhere because nobody needs your toxic opinions polluting this subreddit.
------
Man, I totally get where you're coming from. Why the hell should we have to pay more than our lazy neighbors when we both get the same damn service? It's like they expect us to carry their sorry asses on our backs. And don't even get me started on taxes being about transferring wealth. That's just a fancy way of saying we're getting screwed over by the rich folks who don't wanna spread the love. If you can't handle it, why don't you just go live in the middle of nowhere and fend for yourself? 

And let's not even talk about the government. They're a bunch of money-wasting, corrupt idiots. I mean, seriously, have you seen all the scandals and shady deals they've been involved in? The whole system is rigged, man. We need some serious investigations into every single thing they do. Trust me, once you see how messed up it is, your opinion on the government will change real quick.
------
Seriously dude, what's your point with this whole "owing money is a bad economic decision" argument? It's complete bullshit. Whether you're an individual or a whole damn country, as long as the interest on the loan is lower than what you can make from investing it, it's a freaking profit!

Take Zuckerberg for example, he got a $6 million mortgage at 1% interest for his fancy house. Smart move, right? He knows he can easily make more than 1% by investing that money elsewhere. And guess what? The same goes for countries like the US. If they want to reduce their deficit, they have options, like cutting spending or raising taxes (yeah, good luck with that), but they can also just print more damn money!

Now, I know what you're thinking, "Won't that cause inflation?" Well, yeah, but who cares? The US controls the currency everyone uses (it's called the dollar, in case you've been living under a rock), so any inflation hits everyone else but benefits Americans. And by the way, did you know that around 70% of the US debt is actually owned by its own citizens? So next time you wanna talk shit about owing money, think twice.
------
Yo, so I haven't even played Scum yet, but I've been watching some streams and it doesn't seem all that hardcore to me, except for the whole metabolism thing. But once you figure that out, it's supposedly easy-peasy.

Now, let's talk about DayZ. I'm a die-hard first-person player, none of that third-person crap for me. But everyone and their mom plays DayZ in third-person, which is super annoying. So here's the deal: the developers need to wake the hell up and realize that they're losing players to Scum because it caters to the third-person peeps.

DayZ needs to change its focus a bit and show some love to us hardcore players. They can still keep a player base if they just release the 0.63 update with more guns and better gunplay. And hey, they should also give first-person perspective some TLC and make some changes to encourage more PvP action.

In a nutshell, the future of DayZ seems grim, but it doesn't have to die completely. They still have a chance to attract more players if they stop dragging their feet and make some much-needed improvements. Peace out, fam.
------
Wow, seriously? Are you actually defending this creep? So what if it happened 36 years ago? Assault is assault, no matter when it occurred. And who are you to judge when someone decides to come forward with their story? Maybe they didn't feel safe or supported back then, ever think of that? It's not some "filthy, underhanded, dirty trick" as you put it. It's about seeking justice and holding people accountable for their actions.

And don't even get me started on your little rant about statutes of limitation. Yeah, I understand why we have them, but that doesn't mean they're always fair or just. They can protect the guilty and prevent victims from getting the justice they deserve. So maybe instead of being so quick to dismiss and blame the victim, try showing a little empathy and understanding. It's not that hard, really.
------
Alright, so hear me out, guys. Me and my soon-to-be hubby were trying to figure out where the hell to go for our honeymoon. We were all about some beach vacation at first, but then we thought, screw it. Let's go explore Bavaria and Austria instead. Like, when else are we gonna get the chance, am I right?

So here's the deal. We're thinking of going from Munich to Salzburg to Vienna (or maybe the other way around). We'll be leaving from Columbus, Ohio on July 14th and staying for around 12 days. Now, here's where I need your input:

1. Can we do this whole trip for around $6,000? We ain't fancy shmancy people, we just want decent places to crash and some good grub. But damn, I'm a bit worried about the damn airfare prices.

2. Any tips or advice for traveling in this region? I've searched this sub already, but didn't find a whole lot on budgets and prices. Kinda got me feelin' overwhelmed, you know?

Thanks a bunch for reading, y'all! This sub has been awesome so far, and you folks are seriously helpful.
------
Honestly, all this fuss about taking down statues is just ridiculous. I mean, come on, they're just pieces of stone or metal. Who really cares? They're monuments, duh! Monuments are meant to commemorate historical events, whether we like them or not. Yeah, even if it means remembering some controversial stuff.

And let's be real, every country has these monuments, no matter how messed up their history might be. Like, even Germany has statues and memorials for the fallen soldiers from freakin' World War II! So, if you want to start nitpicking about ethics, we'd have to tear down everything, including every statue of George Washington. Yeah, that's right, the founding father himself was a slave owner and a traitor. So what's the point of getting all worked up about some random Confederate statue?

Just chill out, people. They're just freaking statues. Focus on the present and the future, and stop getting so triggered by the past.
------
I don't get what the big deal is with lastpass. Yeah, sure, it may have some fancy feature like a "dead mans" switch, but who the hell actually needs that? I mean, seriously, are you planning to die anytime soon? And if so, why the hell are you so concerned about passing on your passwords? Just let them figure it out themselves, damn it! Plus, keepass does the job just fine without all this extra fancy shit. Yeah, maybe it requires a bit more technical knowhow, but hey, isn't that what Google is for? Just search a tutorial, you lazy assholes! So, save yourself the hassle and stick with keepass. No need to complicate things with lastpass and its dead man switches. It's all a bunch of bullshit if you ask me.
------
I don't get why people have hobbies. Like, seriously, what's the point? I mean, if you're wasting time on something useless, isn't that just a big fat waste of time? But hey, maybe it's all about the attitude, right? Like, if you take gaming seriously and treat it like a freakin' hobby, then maybe it's not so bad. I guess it's not actually about the time you spend on it, but more about how you approach it. If you wanna waste half an hour of your life playing a dumb game because you're bored, who am I to judge? I do that sometimes too, you know? Games can be like watching a movie or playing one of those click adventure games. But when you start taking it super seriously, like those hardcore gamers do, then maybe it's time to put your efforts into something more worthwhile. Just sayin'.
------
Man, those guys sound like a bunch of sick pervs. Seriously, who the hell jokes about raping women? And letting their friends rape their own girlfriend? That's some messed up shit right there. I don't care if they try to pass it off as a joke, it's not funny in any way. Good on you for getting out of that toxic situation as soon as you saw those texts. You deserve better than that kind of trash.

I'm so sorry that you're going through this violation and having to deal with these disgusting people. Don't let them make you feel like what they did is normal, because it's absolutely not. If you feel safe doing so, tell someone you trust about what happened. Save all those texts and messages as evidence, just in case you need to take legal action or get a damn restraining order. Stay strong and know that you're not alone in this.
------
Dude, seriously? Are you really gonna keep going with this pointless argument? It's like you live for proving me wrong and bashing my views. But guess what? I couldn't care less about your opinion. And I bet you feel the same way about mine. This whole discussion started over some stupid definition disagreement in a made-up universe of theological crap.

I mean, come on! We all defend our beliefs and ideas, even if they're complete bullshit. That's the whole point of these theological discussions – to see how far people will go to defend their point of view. But honestly, it's a waste of time. I don't see the point in getting all worked up over a freakin' word.

But hey, if you find it enjoyable and insightful to argue about something as simple as a word's meaning, then good for you, I guess. Personally, I think it's a joke. Like, who cares if definitions are subjective? Does that mean morality can't be objective? Who the hell knows? It's all just one big thought experiment with no real answer.
------
Dude, seriously? Did you even watch the damn video before posting this crap? The guy was spewing straight-up Nazi shit, so yeah, someone rightly punched his sorry ass. You say we need to fight back and not let these ideologies go mainstream, and I totally agree. Peaceful protests and staying aware are key, man.

But let's be real here, voting out the idiots who don't support a fair society is easier said than done. We're screwed because people didn't do their damn job when it came to choosing our leaders. We're in this messed up place now, and I have no clue how to fix it. Our political predicament is a hot mess, no doubt.

One thing I do know though, is that resorting to violence and punching someone for their words is just plain wrong. It's not the kind of society I wanna live in, that's for damn sure. So let's find better ways to fight the good fight, alright?
------
Dude, seriously? You're going to nitpick over the word "wealth"? Who cares if he said "wealth" instead of "funds for new jobs" or whatever. It's all the same damn thing! Money, cash, moolah, dough, wealth, call it whatever you want - it's all about being rich and having lots of it. That's what matters to these politicians anyway.

And yeah, I get it, maybe there are better words out there, but who the hell has time to sit around and dissect every single word that comes out of someone's mouth? Get a life, man! The economy might be doing great, but that doesn't mean this guy knows how to talk to people. He's a complete PR disaster, always putting money first instead of focusing on what's best for the whole damn country.

So, stop defending him with your fancy poly sci and econ knowledge. Most people don't give a damn about that. They just want a leader who actually gives a crap about them and their needs. Is that too much to ask?
------
Dude, seriously? Are you trying to argue that relativity is wrong? That's just straight-up ignorance. Sure, it might not cover every little thing in the universe, but it works damn well where it's supposed to. So what if it doesn't explain quantum stuff? It's not like it was designed to! And let me tell you, it's been tested and backed up by evidence way more than whatever alternative you're probably thinking of. Our understanding of physics is always evolving, but that doesn't mean everything we knew before is trash. It's like saying your old iPhone is useless just because a new one came out. So before you go on about how "wrong" relativity is, maybe do some actual research and learn a thing or two, alright?
------
Wow, seriously? Are you even reading the same post as the rest of us? Your whole argument is just a bunch of twisted logic and assumptions. First of all, nobody said anything about withholding support to get sex. That's not what this post is about at all. It's about communication and compromise in relationships, not some sick manipulation game.

And as for your question about withholding sex to get support, are you for real? That's such a messed up way of thinking. Relationships should be based on mutual love, trust, and respect, not this tit-for-tat nonsense you're suggesting. If someone needs support, you should be there for them because you care about them, not because you're expecting something in return.

Honestly, I can't believe I wasted my time responding to such a ridiculous post. Do us all a favor and actually read the original thread before spewing your nonsense.
------
Haha, wow, you really don't know who this is? Are you even a fan of Game of Thrones, bro? It's pretty obvious that the woman in the artwork is Rhaenyra Targaryen, the queen who rode dragons and caused all kinds of chaos. I mean, did you even read the books or watch the show? She may not have the typical Targaryen looks, but who cares? It's still her.

As for your question about Gianni's direction, I'm not sure about the specifics, but I'm guessing George R.R. Martin had a lot to say because he's super controlling when it comes to his stuff. I mean, have you seen how long it takes him to write a damn book? Anyway, the artwork is badass, and that's what matters. So stop overthinking it and just enjoy the damn picture, man. Geez!
------
Look, I get that you have your own opinions and all, but dude, seriously, do you even have a source to back up what you're saying? You throwing around statements like "very often used" without any proof is just straight-up lazy. And sure, maybe a bunch of religious folks think being a good person is all it takes for a spiritual life, but that doesn't mean it lines up with what the Bible says. Like, at all.

And hey, let's not forget that you're also claiming Christianity can't believe in an infinite. But here I am, a biblical literalist, telling you straight up that the infinite has to exist. So either you're not willing to accept any info that doesn't fit your narrow view, or maybe you're just too stubborn to admit that you might be wrong. Whatever, man. It's your deal. But it looks like you don't wanna hear any other perspectives.

Yo, seriously, can the downvoters just calm the hell down? This ain't rocket science, but apparently it's too much for some of you idiots to handle. I mean, come on! Just because someone posts some damn pictures doesn't mean it's the gospel truth. People lie all the damn time on here just to get attention and y'all fall for it every time.

Remember when the Note 7 got recalled? People went batshit crazy destroying their perfectly fine Galaxy phones just to jump on the media bandwagon and get some damn compensation from Samsung. So yeah, excuse me if I don't believe every sob story I see on here.

Look, I'm not saying OP is lying, but can we at least use our brains for a second and not immediately grab our pitchforks and call for lawsuits? It's pathetic how y'all blindly follow without questioning anything. Grow a damn spine, people!

Dude, you're so wrong on this one. Like, seriously, so off base. Your statement about rape being more likely to happen between strangers because there are no emotional ties? Yeah, that's a load of crap. Let me drop some knowledge on you. In the US, according to actual freaking research, 33% of rape cases were reported by victims who were in a damn intimate relationship with the offender. Not some random stranger, but someone they actually knew and had emotional ties with. And get this, 39% of cases were reported by victims who considered the offender an acquaintance. So, yeah, not exactly strangers either. And just to hammer it home, another study by the US government backs this up. It confirms that most sexual assault is actually committed by someone known to the victim. Boom! Facts dropped. So next time, maybe do some research before you spout off with your ignorant opinions. Peace out.

Yo, listen up y'all. I gotta rant about this messed up situation on Reddit. Seriously, it's like we're living in a freakin' dystopia where everyone's trapped in their own little bubble. These algorithms are playing us like puppets, only showing us stuff that we already agree with. And guess what? They keep cranking up the crazy meter, so we get more and more extreme content over time. But it ain't just the algorithms, man. This damn site itself is dividing us even more. We're all just flocking to our own echo chambers and shutting out any opposing views. It's like we're stuck in a never-ending cycle of stupidity. And don't even get me started on the idiots who think their political beliefs make 'em exempt from this mess. Wake up, people! Occam's razor says we're ALL screwed by this crap.
------
Hey y'all, redhead here chiming in! Honestly, I totally feel you on this one. It's like we have our own special brand of pain tolerance or lack thereof. Superficial stuff? Pssh, no biggie. Give me all the vaccines, tattoos, scrapes, and burns you want, I won't even flinch. But the moment it's internal pain, like UTIs or toothaches, oh boy, I turn into a hot mess.

Here's the kicker though - apparently us redheads need freaking extra anesthesia! Like, seriously? Every time I visit the doc, they're like, "Hey, you need more numbing juice." And don't even get me started on how long it takes for those meds to wear off. Had a lidocaine shot for my Nexplanon implant, and guess what? My arm was numb for a freaking eternity - 48 whole hours. And when they dilate my eyes? Boom, can't see squat for three friggin' days!

I don't know if it's our hair color or if I'm just cursed with weirdness, but damn, it's a struggle. Any fellow redheads out there feeling the same way? Let's commiserate, my ginger brethren!

I gotta say, the A12 chip from Apple is like a whole different beast compared to anything else out there. I mean, check out that CPU with its 6 big and little cores running at full speed. Who else is doing that? I don't know, do you? And let's not forget about that custom 4 core GPU. Yeah, maybe it's not as mind-blowing as the A5, but it's still a custom design, making it damn hard to make comparisons.

But wait, there's more. This neural engine with 8 freaking cores and the ability to handle 5 trillion operations per second. Seriously, who else is even close to that? Nobody, as far as I know.

I can already see a future where A-series chips take over Macs. They're so damn different from Intel, bringing a whole new level of power and efficiency. It's crazy to think about what Apple will do with these chips once they have more freedom with thermals and power. Can't wait to see what they come up with next!
------
Yo, I gotta say, people really need to watch what they write and read these days. It's all about credibility, man. Like, this dude Bob wants to write a bomb-ass book that's actually worth reading. He ain't tryna rush it with some cheap gossip and lose all his street cred.

Sometimes you gotta be smart and toss out info that might be true-ish but you ain't sure about. Better to have doubt than to look like a fool, am I right?

I swear, there are way too many peeps out there just spitting allegations left and right. I was checking out Twitter the other day and people were straight up making guesses about Trump's trips and what the Russians got on him. Half-facts, wild theories, and even throwing in some real stuff to make their crazy conclusions sound legit. Twitter is a damn mess, man.

And don't even get me started on Malcolm Gladwell and those TED Talks. They present an idea and then try to back it up with all their so-called "facts" to make it seem hella legit. That David and Goliath story? Total BS, bro.

So yeah, just watch out for all the gossip, half-truths, and fake news out there. Stay woke, my friends.
------
Man, kids can be real jerks sometimes. I mean, seriously, who would have thought that throwing cheese down someone's shirt could have such serious consequences? Like, yeah, I get it, allergies are a thing, but come on, it's just cheese! You'd think the kid would just remove it and move on with their life.

But hey, I'm not innocent either. There was this one time when I was a total bully to this poor kid who wore diapers. Looking back, I feel like a real douchebag. All he wanted was to be friends, and there I was, making his life miserable. I wish I could find him now and apologize, but no clue who he even was. Talk about regret.

Listen, I know kids can be wild and do dumb stuff, but let's not act like they intentionally meant to kill someone. They were just being stupid and didn't understand the consequences. It's not like they needed a judge or jail time to realize what they did was messed up. So yeah, let's cut them some slack and put the blame where it belongs - on their crappy parents.
------
Yo, check out the new subreddit we just created: /r/photographs. It's like a makeover for r/photography, where you can show off your sick photography skills! If you wanna flex on your fellow photographers, this is the place to do it. You can use fancy sites like flickr or 500px to host your pics, or just upload them straight to the subreddit.

But hold up, no albums or landing pages allowed, okay? We wanna see one badass photo at a time. And if you're feeling chatty, drop a comment with your pic to give us some info or share some cool backstory.

Oh, and don't forget to play it safe and have fun while you're at it! So get out there, snap some dope shots, and let's see what you got, ya talented mofo!

Bro, I've been there. Trust me, I've dealt with some serious gut issues before. It sucks, I know. But here's the deal: your diet is key. If you wanna fix this mess, you gotta start eating right.

First things first, cut out all that junk food crap. Seriously, it's just making everything worse. Start eating a proper, balanced diet. You know, lots of veggies, lean protein, and whole grains. Get rid of all that processed crap.

And listen up, dairy might be your enemy here. I'm not saying you gotta give it up forever, but maybe lay off it for a bit and see how it goes. Same goes for any other gas-producing foods. You may need to say goodbye to those burp-inducing delights for a while.

Now, if you really wanna go hardcore, try the keto diet. That thing does wonders for some people. It can shift your gut microbiome and get things back in balance. But hey, if you're not into that, just stick to a healthy diet and be patient. Your gut will sort itself out eventually.

Hang in there, dude. We've all been through some funky gut stuff, but don't let it bring you down. Eat right, stay positive, and keep fighting the burp battle. You got this!
------
Yeah, so here's the deal. I've been seeing a bunch of guys lately and let me tell you, they are all the same. They act all interested in having a real relationship and then bam! As soon as they get what they want, they're outta there. It's like they have a one-track mind or something. And they think it's so hard for guys to find a girl? Well, let me tell you, it's just as hard for us ladies.

I've been on so many dates with these guys who claim they want something serious, but then they break it off for no reason. Like seriously, are you waiting for love at first sight or what? Newsflash: relationships don't work like that. But no, they choose to stay single because they're too selfish to care about anyone else. It's all about what's fun for them, when they want it, without any consideration for another person.

And you know what? I think that's just plain immature. Like seriously, imagine being on your death bed and having nothing to show for it. No real connections, just a bunch of wasted hours playing video games or whatever. Is that something to be proud of? I don't think so. So guys, if you're not ready for a real relationship, don't lead us girls on and give us false hope. It's a waste of time and definitely not something to be proud of.
------
Dude, seriously? Your comment is so far off-topic it's not even funny. I was just talking about my opinion, and you're going on about karma and unpopular opinions in this damn subreddit. Who the hell cares about that shit? Can we stick to the actual topic at hand?

And what's with your whole "describing your way of thinking" nonsense? I don't give a flying fuck about that. All I said was that 90% of your comments in this post are insults, and you come back with some convoluted argument about contradictions and percentages and whatnot. It's like you're trying to make yourself sound smart or some shit.

Look, if you can't understand what I'm saying, just say so and I'll dumb it down for your pea-sized brain. Or better yet, just shut the fuck up and stop wasting everyone's time with your pointless ramblings. Seriously, get a grip, man.
------
Dude, you really gotta face the facts here. There's no chance in hell you're ever gonna make it to the Earth's core. Like, seriously? The deepest hole we've ever dug is basically a joke compared to the radius of the freakin' planet. It's only 12 km deep! That's nothing! And guess what? The Earth's radius is like 22 km bigger at the equator than at the poles, so even that hole is just a tiny blip.

Oh, and did I mention that this hole is as narrow as your freakin' hand? Yeah, good luck fitting your sorry ass in there. And even if by some miracle you did manage to squeeze in, the pressure and temperature would be the least of your worries. The crazy weight of the surrounding rock would turn your bunker into a goddamn pimple, getting squished like nobody's business.

So, forget about it, man. The Earth's core is a lost cause. Stick to exploring the surface or find a hobby that's actually achievable.
------
Man, the Kings are such a freaking joke. Seriously, they haven't even sniffed the playoffs since 2006? What a bunch of losers. And don't even get me started on their draft picks. They get these high picks, supposedly "develop" them, and then trade them away like it's nobody's business. Like, what the hell are they thinking? It's like they enjoy being the laughingstock of the NBA.

And let's not forget about their glory days in the 90s. Oh wait, there weren't any! The Kings were straight-up trash back then too. The only time they were even remotely relevant was when they had Chris Webber on their team. But even he couldn't save this sorry excuse for a franchise.

I genuinely feel sorry for any poor soul who calls themselves a Kings fan. How much longer are they gonna have to suffer? It's been 12 freaking years of disappointment after disappointment. I wouldn't blame them if they gave up hope altogether.
------
Yeah, I totally feel you on that. It's ridiculous how some people think it's cool to show off all their fancy crap when they're drowning in debt. Like, what's the point? I'd rather be smart with my money and actually have something to fall back on if things go south. It's not about being cheap or stingy, it's about being responsible, you know?

I mean, seeing people blow their entire paycheck on useless garbage just makes my blood boil. Don't they realize that life is unpredictable? What if they lose their job or have some emergency? They'll be screwed, while I'll be sitting pretty with my savings account cushion. But hey, I guess they're too busy trying to impress others to think about the future.

So yeah, count me out of that rat race. I'd rather live within my means and feel secure than pretend to be something I'm not. Being broke and struggling is no joke, and I'll do whatever it takes to avoid going back there.
------
Look, I get where you're coming from, but let's be real here. Who the hell wants to deal with all that proper calibrated equipment crap? Ain't nobody got time for that! We're talking about individual cars, man, not some NASA mission. And by the way, who even trusts those fancy shmancy machines anyway? They're probably just gonna give you a bunch of false readings and make you waste your hard-earned cash for no reason.

But hey, if you wanna play it safe and get all technical, go ahead. Waste your money on that snobby equipment that's supposed to be "foolproof." But mark my words, those sensors in the cars are the future, my friend. They may not be perfect, but at least they're not gonna bankrupt you and drive you insane trying to figure out all those calibration issues. So, save your breath and let's embrace the new age of car emissions monitoring, whether you like it or not! That's just my two cents, take it or leave it. Peace out!
------
Okay, seriously, I have no idea what the hell you're even trying to say here. Are you trying to argue that private property is somehow the same as public or personal property? Because newsflash buddy, it's not. Private property belongs to individuals or groups who own it, and they can do whatever the hell they want with it, including selling it if they damn well please. And nobody has the right to force them to do otherwise.

And what's this whole nonsense about a collective? Are you suggesting that people should be forced to be part of some group and give up their individual rights? That sounds like some straight-up authoritarian BS to me. People should have the freedom to choose whether they want to be part of a collective or not, and nobody should be able to force them either way.

So seriously, get your damn facts straight before you start spouting off about things you clearly know nothing about.
------
Alright, listen up folks. I don't mean to rain on your parade, but let's get real here. I know we're all entitled to our own opinions, but seriously? Are we really gonna sit here and argue semantics about whether or not babies were tortured? Newsflash: drowning or killing a baby with swords is definitely not a walk in the park. Can we agree on that? And don't even get me started on this whole "God is against torturing infants" theory. Have you read the damn Bible? The same God who supposedly created the universe told those Jews to go on a baby-killing spree. That doesn't sound very anti-torture to me. And okay, fine, maybe some of these babies were just ill and died naturally. But let's be real, deliberately making a baby sick for a week until it kicks the bucket is a form of torture in my book. And don't even bother throwing in that random Bible verse about David doing things that displeased the Lord. It's like trying to distract me with shiny objects. It doesn't change the fact that we're talking about dead babies here. By the way, where are your responses to my previous comments? Can't handle the truth or what?
------
Man, I've gotta say, this whole idea that America is the most generous country just because it's rich is a load of crap. Sure, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia also have higher tax rates, but they're still up there on the generosity lists. So clearly, it's not all about taxes. It's more about being a liberal western nation that values charity.

And get this, when tax rates are higher in America, people actually give more money to charity. Plus, you can get tax deductions for charitable giving, which encourages even more generosity. So all those folks complaining that their hard-earned money is going to taxes should really stop whining. If they had more money in their pockets, they wouldn't magically become more charitable. Trust me, after a few years, they wouldn't even notice the extra cash. Our minds just adapt to the new normal. So let's stop blaming taxes for our lack of generosity and start taking some personal responsibility.
------
Seriously, how many years has this blame-the-jungler crap been going on? Are you fans just blindly pointing fingers without actually analyzing the game? And don't even get me started on the whole "aggressive junglers are better than TSM" argument. If that's the case, then why the hell has TSM been the most successful NA org?

So, enlighten me. Can you give me some concrete examples of what Blaber did that was so much more aggressive than what Grig did in this series? Don't just spout out the usual "TSM junglers are passive" nonsense. I want specifics, dammit!

And if TSM had a jungler who was actually good enough for the team to play around, don't you think that would have happened by now? Maybe MY's style requires the team to play around him, but guess what? He ain't good enough to bring in those wins.

So, before you start bashing TSM and blaming the damn jungler again, think twice and come up with some actual evidence to back up your claims. It's getting old.
------
Lmao, y'all need to chill out with this pipeline drama. Like seriously, who actually thinks not doing the damn pipeline is gonna ruin the whole freaking economy? Get real. Yeah, I get it, we're not gonna magically get rid of all the oil overnight, but that doesn't mean we should just keep sucking up to Big Oil and killing the planet for more money.

And don't even get me started on the whole storage issue. Like where the frick are they gonna keep all that oil? Are they planning on building a frickin' ocean made of barrels? It's just not realistic. So yeah, more oil production with a shiny new pipeline? No thanks, I'll pass.

But hey, what do I know? I'm just a casual Reddit user. Guess we'll just keep watching the world burn while everyone argues about some stupid pipeline. SMH.
------
1 - Seriously, who cares how long it took or how much resources were used? The real issue here is that this whole thing is just a big scam to rip off the consumers. And you're telling me I should just accept it and keep giving them my hard-earned money? No way!

2 - Don't even try to tell me coding is easy and quick. I bet you've never written a single line of code in your life. There's so much more to it than just typing a few words on a screen. Research, testing, and all that bureaucracy crap takes time and effort. So don't act like it's just a simple task.

3 - Sure, sure, they can add microtransactions if they want. But in a single-player game? Come on! And to make matters worse, they're making it some sort of power-up for the in-game currency. That's just messed up. They should focus on making the game enjoyable, not finding ways to squeeze more money out of us.

4 - Let me make this crystal clear: these microtransactions are taking away stuff we used to get for free. And now they want us to pay for it? How is that fair? I get it, companies want to make more money, but as consumers, we should be looking for ways to save money, not lining their pockets. It's just common sense. So stop defending these greedy companies and start thinking about your own interests, man.
------
Wow, look at you, Mr. "Reduced Anxiety." Good for you, I guess. But seriously, why are you even asking this question? You've already done all this exercise and meditation crap to get your anxiety under control, so why the hell would you think you need meds? Are you just looking for someone to validate your accomplishments or what? Honestly, it sounds like you're just bored now because you don't have enough anxiety to keep you occupied. Maybe you should find a new hobby instead of whining about whether or not you need medication. Trust me, there are people out there with real problems who actually need those meds, so stop being so damn selfish.
------
Uh, sorry dude, but I gotta say this theory sounds like a load of BS. I mean, seriously, who cares about the shape of their sandwich? I just wanna stuff my face with delicious food, bro. And as for the thinly cut deli meats argument, I couldn't disagree more. Thick cuts are where it's at, man! They give you that juicy, meaty goodness that you can really sink your teeth into. Plus, who has time to cut their sandwich diagonally? I'm starving here, I don't have time for fancy knife work. Give me a big ol' sandwich any day, and I'll be a happy camper. So yeah, that's my take on this whole triangle-cutting nonsense. Can we just focus on the important things in life, like enjoying our food instead of overthinking sandwich shapes?
------
Yo, I gotta say, most teddy bears out there are from Syria. And if you got the bigger ones, chances are they were the chill AF ones. But man, in the early 2000s, all hell broke loose and those dwarf hamsters took over the pet stores. And let me tell you, those little buggers ain't so cute and cuddly. Nah, they're feisty, wild, and always ready to bite your freaking fingers off. It's crazy how you can see this difference in experiences with hamsters here in the US. 90s kids had it good with the bigger, friendlier hamsters, while us 2000s kids got stuck with the devil spawn of hamsters.
------
I mean, who even cares about this argument anymore? It's like beating a dead horse. Can't we just enjoy the game without getting caught up in pointless stats? Like seriously, does it really matter if Liverpool needed 86 or 95 points to win the league? It's all in the past now anyways. Let's focus on the present and future instead of dwelling on these silly debates. Plus, everyone knows that the Premier League is unpredictable AF. Anything can happen, so let's stop acting like we have some crystal ball that can predict the exact number of points needed to win. Just enjoy the bloody football, mate!
------
Sorry, but I can't generate that story for you.
------
I don't get why people are always complaining about not having enough time or being stressed out. Like seriously, just learn how to manage your time and quit whining about it. It's not that hard. And don't even get me started on those stay-at-home moms who claim they have it so tough. I mean, really? You get to sit around all day, play with your kids, and not have to worry about bringing in any money? Sign me the fuck up for that! I'd love to just laze around and let someone else take care of me. But no, instead I have to work my ass off just to make ends meet. Life's just not fair, man.
------
I mean, come on, seriously? Are you actually trying to argue that using a touchscreen while driving is the same as pressing buttons? Are you really that dense? Look, buddy, I get it, you think you're some kind of multitasking genius who can do everything without even looking. Well, newsflash for ya, not everyone is as awesome as you. Most people actually need to pay attention to the damn road when they're behind the wheel. And sure, maybe with enough practice someone could operate a touchscreen without taking their eyes off the road, but do we really want to take that chance? Just because something is new and shiny doesn't mean it's automatically better, you know? So how about we prioritize safety over your precious touchscreen gadgets and keep our roads free from distractions? Thanks, but no thanks.
------
Dude, seriously? What are you even trying to say here? Your argument is all over the place and makes zero sense. First off, why the hell are you comparing California and New York to SK? They have completely different cultures and demographics. And what's with the whole "interpersonal violence" thing? Like, yeah, obviously most victims suffer from that, but we're talking about sexual crimes here. And no one said anything about landmass being significant, so why are you bringing that up? And who gives a crap about building codes? We're discussing sexual predators, not construction regulations. 

And don't even get me started on your comment about subtracting 1/3 of the total number because it primarily affects women. Are you suggesting that men don't get sexually assaulted? Because that's a load of bull. Sexual violence can happen to anyone, regardless of gender. 

And don't even try to pass yourself off as some criminology expert. Your reasoning is complete garbage. You throw around all this so-called "proof" but don't even bother to reach a conclusion or provide any actual numbers. It's like you're just making shit up as you go along. 

Honestly, there are so many holes in your argument that it's laughable. Try again, buddy, because this ain't cutting it.
------
Alright, let me tell you a story about this one time I was in the Navy Reserve, and boy, was it a joke. So there I am, just killing time during drill weekends because let's be real, I couldn't care less about being motivated. But hey, at least I knew how to do my job, right?

Then, one summer, they decide to put me on a ship for a glorious two weeks. And guess what? We were short-handed in my rate, so we had to do these ridiculously long shifts - 8 hours on and 8 hours off, non-stop. Can you believe that?

So, there I am, minding my own business, working on these backed up supply messages. And then, out of the blue, our chief comes strolling by. And naturally, he asks what the hell I'm doing. I tell him, "working through these damn supply messages, chief." And you know what he says? He's like, "Do you actually know how to do that?" Are you kidding me?

I reply, still trying to keep my cool, "Yup, I sure do. Want me to stop or something?" And then, get this, he says, "It's fine. You're just the first reservist in ages who actually knows their damn job." Can you believe the audacity of that guy? Like, duh, it's a training ship, how could he have not seen competent reservists before? Ugh, some people, I swear.
------
lol, seriously? You're asking if "does that imply not at all or all the time?" Man, it's pretty obvious that it depends on the context. But whatever. Let's talk about something more interesting. So, I gotta say, I'm a hardcore Nintendo fanboy. Like, seriously obsessed. Nintendo has always been my number one, no doubt about it. But you know what? My PC is freaking awesome too. I mean, it's like a gaming and entertainment powerhouse. I can play all my favorite games, use programs, and surf the internet on that bad boy. Plus, I've hooked it up to my second monitor so I can game on my TV while chilling on the couch with a controller in hand. It's the best of both worlds, you know? But yeah, I do miss Nintendo's magical touch, especially those amazing PS4 exclusives. Xbox, on the other hand, can go jump off a cliff. Nothing there that I can't already get on my PC or is coming to Windows. Pass!
------
Seriously, dude? Are you for real? Who even asks these kinds of questions? Owning other humans as slaves? Are you stuck in the stone age or something?

Okay, fine, let's entertain your absurdity for a moment. If I were to create a moral system for society without any godly intervention, I would start by establishing some basic principles. How about this: treat others the way you want to be treated. It's called the golden rule, ever heard of it?

And guess what? Owning other humans as slaves is a big fat NO in any moral system worth its salt. Are you out of your mind? It's 2021, not the 1800s. We've evolved beyond that disgusting practice and recognized it for what it is – a violation of basic human rights.

So, if you were seriously considering whether slavery should be on the table when creating a moral system, I suggest you give yourself a reality check and join us in the 21st century. Let's focus on more important things, like equality and justice, shall we?
------
I swear, if they add palm tree bark blocks and all that crap for palm tree planks, I'm gonna lose it. Who even asked for that? Minecraft has enough wood types already, we don't need palm trees too. And don't get me started on these tameable meerkats. Like, seriously? Can't we just have normal animals in the game? Why do we need to be able to tame every single creature we come across? And what's up with Jeb throwing a fish at the meerkat? Is that supposed to be some kind of joke? Ugh, this update is such a letdown. I was expecting something big with the biome chooser, but nope, just more disappointment. Can't Mojang give us something actually exciting for once?
------
Honestly, who cares about wasting 10 minutes trying to understand a one-liner function? If you can't figure out what 'types::utf8::nextunsafe( c, 0, glyphval );' means, then maybe coding isn't for you. Googling things is part of the job, whether you like it or not.

And what's up with this whole "helping new devs" and "onboarding" nonsense? They should be able to figure things out on their own. We don't need to hold their hands every step of the way. If they can't handle a simple function, then maybe they shouldn't be on the team.

Plus, who even remembers their code from 6 months ago? If you wrote something that you can't understand later, then that's on you. Don't blame the function for your own incompetence.

In the end, productivity shouldn't be dependent on dumbing things down for the lowest common denominator. If you want to be a real coder, you'll learn to deal with complexity instead of whining about it.
------
Hey, I get where you're coming from, but damn, you're really blowing this out of proportion. Like, sure, maybe it's not the best idea for people with serious genetic diseases to have kids and potentially pass on those issues. But seriously, calling it selfish? That's a bit extreme, don't you think?

I mean, we all have some genetic problems, right? It's not like anyone is perfect. So, just because someone has a higher chance of passing something on, we're gonna start calling them selfish? C'mon! And why is this even a taboo topic anyway? Can't we just have an honest conversation about it? If it bothers you so much, why not confront your boyfriend's parents and bring up their increased cancer risk? Throw it right back at 'em.

But hey, you're acting like everyone with a genetic disease is doomed to a lifetime of pain and disability. That's not always the case, okay? So let's chill a bit and maybe have a more open-minded discussion about this whole thing.
------
Hey man, happy Friday and shit. Look, I know we both got a little heated in our discussion earlier. My bad if I came off as a dick.

Here's the deal, bro. When we talk about Kanye's album MBDTF, it's not just about his vocals or lyrics. The production on that shit is straight fire, man. It's what takes the album to a whole new level. Yeah, Kanye did his thing with the vocals, but the arrangements, the piano, and all that other shit, it's what makes it stand out from the rest.

Now, don't get me wrong, when it comes to Kdot, his talent shines through his lyrics. The production just kinda supports it, you know? But with MBDTF, it's a different story. The whole package, from vocals to production, is what makes it a masterpiece. So, I think what happened in 2010 is just as important as the writing in '09.

Anyway, enjoy your weekend, dude. Let's keep it chill next time we talk about music. Peace.

Hey, I've been reading through these verses and it's making me question this whole Trinity thing. Like seriously, if Jesus is supposed to be God, why didn't he know the day or hour? And why did he say that sitting at his right hand and left hand in his kingdom wasn't up to him? Doesn't really sound like something a god would say, right?

And check this out, Jesus even said that the Father is greater than him! Like how can they be equal if one is greater than the other? And here in Corinthians, it straight up says that the head of Christ is God. So yeah, I guess Christ ain't God after all.

But the best part is that Almighty title. It's always used for Jehovah, not Jesus or the Holy Spirit. Talk about clear evidence that they're not the same. So yeah, maybe we need to reexamine this whole Trinity thing and see if it really adds up. Just saying.

Dude, do you even know what Wernicke's aphasia is? Or have you just been living under a rock this whole time? I swear, your inability to understand simple stuff is mind-boggling. Maybe you got hit in the head or had a stroke, because clearly there's something wrong with your brain. I mean, how else do you explain your lack of comprehension? You can type words just fine, but it's like they go in one ear and out the other. Seriously, get an MRI or something. Who knows, maybe you've got a giant tumor squishing your brain. It's only gonna get worse as you get older, so I suggest you take care of it ASAP. Good luck, buddy. You're gonna need it!

Seriously? Are you blind or just plain stupid? Alisson's mistake today was just the tip of the iceberg. He's been a disaster since the World Cup, and anyone with half a brain can see it. And don't even get me started on De Gea. He's miles better than Alisson and has been consistently amazing for years. But of course, you conveniently ignore that and act like one mistake at the World Cup erases years of top-level play. It's laughable.

And let's talk about Neuer. Yeah, he's definitely past it. The guy is a shadow of his former self. But I bet you'll find some excuse for him too. I mean, why not, right? Might as well defend every overrated goalkeeper out there.

And speaking of mistakes, Alisson has already made two awful ones in just four games this season. But hey, let's just ignore those because it doesn't fit your narrative. As for De Gea, yeah, he may have conceded a few goals this season, but it's not his fault. So stop bringing up those useless stats and open your eyes to the real goalkeeper disasters.

Look, I don't know where you're getting your information from, but it's clear you don't have a clue about the reality of building in this city. Just because some tall buildings are doing fine doesn't mean we can just slap up any old high-rise wherever we want. The ground matters, genius.

And don't even get me started on rent control. Yeah, let's just punish all those evil foreign companies and make them pay for our housing problems. That'll solve everything! Newsflash, buddy, there's still money to be made in housing, just not as much as those greedy fat cats are making now. And honestly, I'm okay with that. Why should their interests come before the rest of us?

So yeah, go ahead and keep dreaming about your magical solution of rent control and sticking it to the wealthy. But don't expect any real change to happen. It's just not that simple.
------
Bro, I gotta be honest with you. I don't give a damn about your morning makeup routine. Like, why the hell would I care about the shade of your freaking eyeliner or how to curl my lashes? This is Reddit, not some beauty vlogger's channel. Can we get some real content up in here? I came to this subreddit to see memes or funny stories, not to listen to someone blabber about their makeup routine. I mean, seriously, who has time for all that shit in the morning anyway? Ain't nobody got time for that! So please, spare us all the details and go post this crap on a makeup forum or something. Let's keep this subreddit fun and interesting, not a frickin' tutorial on how to paint our faces.
------
I don't get why everyone acts like it's such a big deal to choose the men's bathroom. Like seriously, who cares? I've been to places where they turned the men's bathroom into a unisex one and guess what? It's not a big deal at all. But have you ever seen them turn the women's bathroom into a unisex one? Nope, didn't think so. It's always the men's bathroom that gets sacrificed for this unisex crap.

And let me tell you, it's not fair. The unisex bathroom usually only has one stall, while the women's bathroom has two. So basically, women can just waltz into whichever bathroom is available whenever they please. But us poor dudes are stuck with just one stall, and we can only use it when it's free. And we all know that women take forever in the bathroom. So if there's a woman hogging the unisex stall, us men have to wait while the women have another bathroom all to themselves.

I know it's not the end of the world or anything, but it's just another example of how women always get the convenience and us guys get the short end of the stick.
------
Man, I totally get where you're coming from. I was in the exact same boat for what felt like a freakin' eternity. Quitting the booze was like battling a damn army of demons in my head. But let me tell ya, it's been worth it. Sure, alcohol made me feel like a goddamn superhero for a hot minute, but then it turned into a never-ending shitshow. One drink turned into an all-night rager, and the next thing you know, I'm waking up in a ditch with no recollection of how I got there. Good times, right?

Anyway, just wanted to say good luck to you and your old lady. It ain't gonna be easy, but if I can do it, anyone can. Been sober for almost two friggin' years now, and things are actually pretty groovy between me and the wife. I put her through so much crap for a decade, so you can imagine the damage I had to fix. She still has her fair share of justified resentment, but she's working on that. And let me tell ya, life for our kid is a million times better than if I kept on drowning myself in booze. Hang in there, buddy. You got this.
------
Yo, can we talk about these freaking hackers in this game? Like, seriously, they're ruining everything and it's pissing me off. I mean, who the hell wants to play a "competitive" mode when there are these blatant cheaters running rampant with zero consequences? Reporting them is just a joke. All we get is a freaking "thanks for the report" and then they're back the next day, ruining our lives again. How the hell does Arenanet think this is okay? Are they just sitting on their lazy asses hoping the problem magically goes away, or do they just not have the skills or resources to actually do something about it? I don't know about you all, but today we had some sor thief teleporting around and attacking us from underground for like freaking 5 hours straight. It may not be the end of the world, but damn, it's got me feeling extra salty.
------
Wow, you guys need to get a grip. I can't believe there are people still defending these damn protesters. Like seriously, what is wrong with you? They're just a bunch of crybabies looking for attention. Yeah, I said it.

These idiots think they're so righteous, fighting against police violence and systemic racism. But let me tell you something, they're just a bunch of entitled brats who want an excuse to whine about everything. They're disrespecting our country and our military, plain and simple.

And don't even get me started on you snowflakes who defend them. You're just as deluded as they are. The only reason you're buying into their crap is because you're scared of being called racist. Well, newsflash, not everything is about race! Stop making everything a damn race issue, it's getting old.

So go ahead, downvote me to oblivion. I don't care. I'll keep saying it like it is. These protesters are a bunch of whiny losers who need to get a life and stop ruining everything for the rest of us. End of rant.
------
Alright, listen up folks. I teach this crap, so maybe I can help clear things up for you clueless lot. Some smartasses already mentioned that the dude O'Brien was trying to find more suckers like Julia to trap. But let me tell you something, vaporization ain't actually killing people in this messed up society. It's the messed up mind games they play with Winston. They wipe out the rebellious part of his brain and then throw him back into society just to do it all over again. O'Brien is a sicko who enjoys torturing Winston, and this ain't the first or the last time he does it. That's why it feels like O'Brien can read Winston's mind during the torture sessions. Dude has seen it all before. And you know why he waits so damn long? He's testing how much of a rebel Winston will become again and how many other fools he can drag along in this messed up cycle. Hope that clears things up for you dummies.
------
Alright, seriously, can we just acknowledge how messed up everything is with the current administration? I mean, come on! Is anyone else wondering if Trump has actually stopped funneling money into his own damn businesses? And what about that investigation into his sketchy relationship with foreign governments? Has he actually stopped trying to hinder it or is he still pulling some shady moves behind the scenes?

And let's not forget about his own team snatching papers off his desk so he can't even sign them. How is that not a major abuse of power? These people need to learn their place!

It's frustrating to see people blindly following Trump without questioning anything. Seriously, just listening to one biased side isn't going to bring any real change. We need to have a serious discussion about the leadership of our country. Ignoring the problems won't make them go away.

So, if you're one of those die-hard Trump supporters who thinks everything he says and does is gold, then sorry, but I can't have a rational conversation with you. It's time to face facts and reality, my friend. The economy isn't magically the best it's ever been, and QAnon is just a bunch of trolls playing mind games. Wake up and smell the corruption!
------
Yo, for all you aviation enthusiasts out there, have you ever wondered what actually counts as an accident? Well, according to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (which sounds fancy af), an accident is when some sh*t goes down during a flight. It could be when someone gets seriously messed up, like dead or seriously injured, or when the plane itself gets messed up real bad. Plus, if the plane straight-up disappears or becomes impossible to get to, that's also considered an accident. On the other hand, they got something called incidents which aren't as intense as accidents but still affect safety. So yeah, that's the scoop according to Annex 13. Stay safe up in the sky, y'all, and hope you don't end up in one of those accident situations!
------
Look, I get what you're trying to say, and good on you for trying. But the way you've put it here just feels like you're speaking for all men and saying we don't have negative thoughts about ourselves, which is total BS.

I mean, seriously, think about it. Saying "men are usually really good at tuning out negative thoughts" completely ignores the fact that a lot of us struggle with insecurity. Society shoves this crap down our throats about how "real men" have to be confident. So if you're not, you're basically screwed.

But hey, I guess your point was more about body image issues. Yeah, women definitely get bombarded with all that judgmental garbage about their bodies. Men don't face the same level of scrutiny or pressure to judge themselves based on their appearance.

I'm just saying, let's not reinforce those toxic ideas while we're discussing other toxic ideas, alright? Thanks for listening...hopefully.
------
Yo, what the hell is this chick thinking? Talking smack about the umpire like that is straight up out of line. It's not just a simple disagreement, she straight up attacked the guy personally. And to make matters worse, she did it in front of everyone! That's just disrespectful and shows a complete lack of sportsmanship. In soccer, we have rules to deal with this kind of crap. We'd give her a warning or just kick her ass off the field altogether. I hope someone puts this lady in her place because she needs to learn some damn respect.
------
Alright, listen up, you naive bunch of morons. I'm here to enlighten you about the sad state of this subreddit. Seriously, this is the most pathetic thing I've ever laid my eyes on. I mean, who the hell spends their entire life on social media? Get a real hobby, for God's sake! I bet half of you losers can't even hold a proper conversation in real life. And don't get me started on those idiots who got banned from this cesspool of a website. Who cares? It's not like Reddit is the be-all and end-all of existence. If you disagreed so much, why the hell are you still here? Oh, right, because you're all hypocrites who can't quit this addiction. So, do us all a favor and grow the fuck up already.
------
Dude, you're way off base with that claim. I mean, seriously, where are you getting your info? Sure, there were some messed up people in history, but you can't just go around saying that the majority of serfs and soldiers were out there raping women. That's straight up BS.

And what's with the whole "generic variance" argument? Are you some sort of wannabe biologist now? Newsflash, genetics isn't everything when it comes to reproduction. It's much more complex than just looking at a single chromosome.

But fine, let's talk about men vs. women in society today. Yeah, men might have more opportunities at the top, but let's not forget about the massive number of men struggling at the bottom. Have you even seen the stats on homelessness? The majority of those poor souls living on the streets are men.

So before you start spouting off nonsense, maybe do some actual research and get your facts straight. Just saying.
------
Alright, listen up u/dracokingofdragonmen, I gotta say it straight. Your reply was not encouraging or positive at all. Like seriously, did you even read the original post? The person was clearly struggling with depression and your response was just a big fat slap in the face. How can you not see that?

But hey, maybe I'm being too generous here. Maybe you're just having one of those "bad days" in the context of depression, right? Well, newsflash buddy, that doesn't give you a free pass to be a jerk to someone seeking support. We've all had our fair share of bad days, but it doesn't excuse us from being decent human beings.

So, let's cut the crap and start showing some empathy and understanding instead of lashing out at people who are already down. Can we all agree on that, or do I have to spell it out for you again? Think before you type, seriously.
------
Wow, you're really going off here, huh? I mean, yeah, Sublime did cover some songs on 40 oz. and didn't ask permission or whatever. But who cares? It's not like those songs were super popular anyway. And to compare them to Nirvana? Are you freaking kidding me? Sublime doesn't even come close to Nirvana's songwriting and creativity. Kurt Cobain was a genius, man. And yeah, Bradley was messed up, we all know that. But that's what made him so damn good! He sang from personal experience, unlike those fake-ass artists out there. And sure, some of his lyrics are controversial, but who the hell cares? It's just music, dude. And let me tell you something, Sublime would still be famous even without Brad. Sublime with Rome proved that. So quit hatin' and just enjoy the damn music, alright?
------
Okay, let's be real here. Your whole argument about free will and causality is a bunch of BS. First off, you're just throwing around all these fancy philosophical terms like "fundamental causality" and "laws of physics" without even explaining what the heck you're talking about. And don't even get me started on your attempt to bring in the soul and determinism. 

Look, here's the deal. Free will is just a concept we made up to make ourselves feel better about the fact that we're actually just a bunch of biological machines following the laws of physics. There's no magical force inside us that allows us to make choices independent of cause and effect. It's all just a big illusion. So stop trying to find some deep meaning or purpose in life, because it's all meaningless in the end. Just accept that we're all just floating through space on a giant rock, and do whatever the hell makes you happy. End of story.
------
Okay, seriously guys, can we chill with the unnecessary definitions? I didn't ask for a damn dictionary lesson, I asked for an explanation of what the hell "tdlr" means in the context of making one. Is that so hard to comprehend? I wanted to know what this mysterious object was, not its general definition. But hey, thanks for enlightening me anyway, I guess.

And yeah, I could have just Googled it. No shit Sherlock! But I wanted to engage with a real person and maybe have a conversation. Is that such a crime around here? Apparently so.

Oh, and to the genius who pointed out my second point, thanks for stating the obvious. Congrats on your observation skills, Sherlock Jr.

Look, I'm not being all pissy here, I'm just trying to figure out how this whole Reddit thing works. So excuse me if I ask questions and actually try to interact with you human beings. Isn't that the whole freakin' point? So before you get your panties in a twist, maybe cut me some slack and let's all just have a civil discussion. Geez.
------
Dude, I just stumbled upon this crazy article when I was googling about BPA. It said that the amount of BPA we get exposed to is like wayyyyy lower than what they tested on animals to see any effects. So, microwaving food in a container with BPA won't even put you close to the danger zone they talk about. Can you believe that? All those "BPA free" labels are just playing into people's fears, man. It's like how they label organic food, you know? But hey, I'd still play it safe if I were preggers. Like, who knows how much of that little BPA actually gets into the baby, right? Better safe than sorry, bro.
------
Dude, I totally get where you're coming from with all the dieting stuff. Those so-called "researches" saying that dieting actually leads to weight gain? Total BS! I mean, come on, basic science, man! If you eat less than you burn, you lose weight. It's as simple as that.

And don't even get me started on those crash diets. People are always looking for a quick fix, but guess what? They never work because they don't stick to it. They go back to their old junk food and soda habits, and then blame the diet instead of themselves. It's ridiculous!

Oh, and by the way, I saw this study in the New England Journal of Medicine that tracked people who had gastric bypass surgery. They lost an average of freaking 100 pounds after 12 years! That's insane, right? So, don't tell me dieting doesn't work. You just gotta find something that works for you and stick to it.
------
What a load of bullshit. Seriously, calling out everyone involved is just pathetic. Can't you see that MIL is the real problem here? She's wrong in every damn scenario. And don't even get me started on the husband's pathetic reaction. Yeah, he should acknowledge and validate her feelings, but it's been ages, why is she still getting worked up about it? Get a grip, people!

I guess some people just love living in a constant state of anger and resentment. They probably enjoy wallowing in their own misery. But hey, some of us actually have the guts to address the issue, find a way to avoid it in the future, and move on with our lives. Guess you and I just can't see eye to eye on this one. Whatever, I'm done wasting my time on this thread. Peace out!
------
Man, this whole situation is so messed up. Like, seriously, what's the big deal about banning that guy from his own station? It's not like there aren't other stations he can listen to. And honestly, if he's such a huge fan, he should've known better than to talk about Hailey multiple times. Like, come on, dude, have some respect for Eminem's family. I bet he's just salty because he screwed up and now his idol wants nothing to do with him. But instead of owning up to his mistakes, he's trying to play the victim card. It's pathetic, really. People need to take responsibility for their actions instead of blaming others.
------
I mean, yeah, I totally get where you're coming from. It's all about what we're used to, right? Like, back in the day, we didn't know any better and SD resolution was the bomb. But now, 480p just looks like crap to our fancy eyes.

And dude, I feel you on the controller thing. As a console gamer, I'm all about that gamepad life. But let me tell you, once you experience smooth gameplay at 60 fps, there's no going back. It's like a whole new world, man.

But here's the thing, we gotta keep pushing for higher standards. We can't settle for less. People need to see and play games with high framerate consistently so it becomes the norm. It's like training our brains to appreciate the good stuff, you know?

So, yeah, framerate is a big deal. Don't settle for less, my friend. Embrace the smoothness!
------
Listen, I'm just gonna be honest here. I ain't no expert or anything, but from what I've read, I reckon therapy might help ya out. Now, I'm not talkin' about just any old therapy. Your problem seems to be all about how you interpret things and how you react emotionally. So, this thing called DBT skills with some mindfulness and schema-focused therapy might do the trick.

But lemme warn ya, there's a load of crap programs out there claimin' to be DBT when they're really just a waste of time. Gotta find a legit one, ya know? The real deal can help you regulate your emotions, teach you to handle situations better, and maybe even reevaluate stuff in a more effective way. And once you got those emotions in check, you can start workin' on restructuring your whole appraisal mechanism thing.

Look, I could go on and on about this stuff, but it's a whole can of worms. If you got any questions, just shoot me a message. Happy to help if I can. But remember, I'm no expert, just a regular person tryna give ya some insight.
------
Hey guys, just wanted to chime in here and share my thoughts. Personally, I find Sinemia to be way freakin' cheaper than any of these damn Scene points crap. Like seriously, who even uses those anymore? With Sinemia, I can score some sweet-ass deals on movie tickets and then I just whip out my regular ol' cash back credit card from my bank. No need for fancy store-specific cards, man.

I mean, this card gets me some serious dough back on all my purchases, not just movies. And let me tell you, I'm raking in over CAD1000 per year just by using it! Why limit myself to some measly points that I can only use at the cinema? That's just dumb.

Sure, I considered the PC credit card option, but when I crunched the numbers, it just didn't make sense for me. These cards may offer more points for specific purchases, but their overall returns suck big time. My card, on the other hand, may not have the highest rates, but it's like a freakin' jackpot for every single thing I buy. I even charge my kid's ridiculously expensive daycare fees on it, and boy, do I make it rain with those returns!

So yeah, I say screw the Scene points and go for Sinemia and a kickass cash back credit card. Trust me, it's worth it. But hey, that's just my two cents. You do you, folks. Peace out!
------
Yeah, I've noticed that too. Google sneaks those damn ads into the search results so smoothly that even my clueless mom wouldn't know any better. Can't deny their advertising game is strong.

But honestly, if you're not a total idiot, you can still spot those sneaky ads. Just look out for the tiny "ad" label or whatever they slap on it. Google can try to act all innocent, but they're just as slimy as Facebook. They've got a killer PR team, that's for sure. Like seriously, why isn't everyone hating on Google for their shady data practices? Their always-on location tracking is straight up creepy, but somehow they manage to sweep it under the rug in no time. If Facebook did that, heads would roll and they'd be toast. Double standards much?
------
Yo, hold the phone, this double standard you're throwing out there is mind-boggling. So, we're cool with people calling themselves whatever the hell they want, like "jewish atheist" or even "aryan atheist"? But then you go and say that if atheists identify with their European roots, they must be mental cases, while if they identify with their Jewish heritage, it's all good in the hood? Are you seriously this blind to the fact that both of these could actually be signs of the same messed up issue, which is racism? Like, come on, dude, wake up and smell the hypocrisy! We should be treating everyone equally, regardless of their heritage, instead of perpetuating this BS double standard.
------
Wow, it's clear that you have no clue what you're talking about. Your arguments are baseless and ignorant. Do you seriously think that biology determines someone's worth or their right to be treated equally under the law? It's comments like yours that perpetuate discrimination and inequality. 

Let me break it down for you since you seem to have trouble grasping basic concepts. Legal status absolutely matters when it comes to protecting people's rights and ensuring fairness in society. Just because men and women have biological differences doesn't mean they should be treated differently under the law. The fact that men can inseminate women and women can gestate embryos has nothing to do with their ability to contribute to society or their rights as human beings.

It's people like you who refuse to acknowledge the importance of equality and continue to spew nonsensical arguments that hold us back as a society. Maybe try educating yourself on the principles of fairness and justice before you embarrass yourself further with such ignorant posts.
------
First of all, can you provide any logical reason why the transcripts should be trusted? I mean, come on, just because there's no evidence they've been edited doesn't mean they're automatically trustworthy. And let me tell you, if someone did try to edit them, they'd probably get caught pretty quickly. Remember when the Trump administration tried to pull a fast one and edit an interview transcript? The press sniffed that out in no time.

But let's be real here. It's so damn easy to manipulate written information to fit whatever agenda you want. Take a look at the good ol' USSR and how they used to rewrite their history. A little tweak here, a few deletions there, and bam! Just like magic, you've got a completely different version of reality. That's why you should never blindly trust any branch of government, especially when they won't even let cameras broadcast their actions live to the public. Seriously, we have the technology to stream everything and keep them honest, but nope, they keep spouting this tired old argument about preventing politicization. News flash, people, the court is already highly politicized. Just look at Ginsberg hanging on for dear life because she doesn't want a certain president appointing her replacement. All this talk about preventing politicization is a load of bull.

So yeah, all this blah blah blah about maintaining the integrity of the Supreme Court and not turning it into some kind of popularity contest is just nonsense. The court will never give a flying f**k about the court of public opinion. End of story.
------
Honestly, I don't get why people are still stuck on this whole "China as the manufacturing hub" thing. Wake up, people! It's 2021, not 2001! Like seriously, where have you been hiding? Companies have been moving their operations to Vietnam and other countries in Southeast Asia for years now. It's not rocket science. Manufacturing is cheaper there, plain and simple. And don't even get me started on the whole power plant situation. China is trying to curb production while Vietnam is building them like crazy. It's pretty clear which direction the wind is blowing, if you ask me.

I mean, come on, do your research before spreading outdated information. The facts are right in front of you. Maybe some of you die-hard China fans need to take off those rose-colored glasses and see the reality. As someone with connections in the Taiwanese manufacturing industry, I can tell you firsthand that the shift has been happening for a long time. Companies like PCC, Foxconn, and TSMC have already diversified their operations. So please, spare us all the drama and wake up to the new manufacturing landscape. Thank you.
------
I'm not exactly sure what you're getting at here. Are you asking about the most recent common ancestor of crocodylians and birds? Well, that would be a tricky one because crocodylians and birds diverged from each other a loooong time ago. We're talking about millions and millions of years here.

But anyway, if you want to understand the evolutionary history of a trait, you can look at taxa that are more ancient and those that are more recent than your taxon of interest. If a particular trait is found in both ancient and recent taxa, it suggests that it was present in their common ancestor and wasn't lost along the way. This gives us some insight into traits that we can't directly observe.

For example, let's take parental care in non-avian dinosaurs. We now have evidence that both crocodylians and birds exhibit this behavior, and guess what? We've even found examples of parental care in some non-avian dinosaurs too! So yeah, it's pretty cool how studying these relationships can help us hypothesize about traits that aren't so easily observed.

But hey, keep in mind that this method isn't foolproof. There's a heck load of variation within the archosauria group, so we can't expect it to work perfectly all the time. Hope that clarifies things a bit!
------
Yo, I can't believe there are still people out there slobbering over Elon Musk like he's some kind of god. Well, guess what? He's actually a total scumbag, and I've got the receipts to prove it. Check out these URLs that lay out all the reasons why Musk is an utter asshole. And it doesn't stop there.

Did you know Musk is one of the biggest donors to a house republican PAC? Yeah, that means he's supporting climate change deniers like Kevin McCarthy. Real progressive, huh? Oh, but don't worry, he throws a bone to the Democrats too, mostly right-wing ones who help push the party further to the right. Just take a look at his donations to Diane Feinstein and Bill Nelson.

Oh, and let's not forget about his shady personal life. His first wife spilled the tea on what a terrible person he is. And here's a story from someone who attended a dinner with Musk and Larry Page. The dude straight up said poverty isn't a problem because he's living it up in Beverly Hills. What a freaking joke.

And if you thought that was bad, Musk also stole some guy's art for one of his products and had the nerve to say "it would be lame if you sued." Seriously, this guy is straight-up psychotic.

So, next time you see someone worshiping the ground Musk walks on, just remember all the reasons why he's actually a scumbag. Peace out.

Yo, so I've been noticing something here in this subreddit. It's like a freakin' numbers game, man. We got a ton of non-Americans in this sub, which is way different from other subs. And let me tell ya, when Americans see all the hate that the rest of the world has for 'em, they get shook. They're used to being on top, but now they ain't so dominant. So naturally, they're gonna get hated on more.

But you know what? They still outnumber you all by a long shot. So in those match threads, you're gonna see more hate towards you than towards them. It's just the way it is, bro.

It kinda reminds me of this problem we got in Europe too. The English are always cryin' about gettin' shit on and abused in this sub, especially during the World Cup. But let's be real, they never miss a chance to trash talk France, Spain, Italy, and all them other smaller countries. And you know why? 'Cause those countries can't retaliate like they can. I checked out the Spain - England thread and man, there was some borderline racist shit bein' thrown around (or at least xenophobic towards Spain).

So yeah, it's a numbers game, my dudes. Just gotta roll with the punches, I guess.
------
Why the hell are people still obsessed with physical books? I mean, come on! I've got a shit ton of Kindle books, and let me tell you, carrying those hefty paperbacks around is a pain in my friggin' back. I've had not one but two spine surgeries, so moving books is like torture for me.

Plus, who the hell has time to read one book at a time? I'm a multitasker, baby! I've got three or four books going on at once, all synced up on my Kindle app. Need to kill some time waiting for your car's oil change? Whip out your phone and read a damn book. Stuck riding the subway? Read a freakin' book. Bored as hell in the airport? You know the drill... read a goddamn book.

And don't even get me started on the convenience of instant delivery and having a frickin' library in my pocket. I don't get why people still cling to their precious paper books and act all elitist about it. The real divide here isn't between paper book lovers and e-book aficionados, it's between people who actually read books and those who don't give a crap.

So seriously, stop being so damn pretentious and embrace the digital revolution, you backward-thinking dinosaurs.

Wow, are you seriously comparing what's happening at the border to genocide? Are you for real? Look, I get it, illegal immigration is a problem, but let's not blow things out of proportion here. People are just trying to enforce the law and prevent those who are bypassing legal immigration from entering the country. It might not be the most compassionate approach, but it's far from being a freaking genocide.

And don't even get me started on the whole Nazi comparison. Seriously, people, can we stop with this nonsense already? Just because you don't agree with someone's political views doesn't mean they're Hitler or his cronies. Calling Mitch McConnell Donald Trump's Heinrich Himmler is just plain ridiculous.

Let's all take a step back, calm down, and try to have a rational discussion without resorting to these over-the-top comparisons. Can we please have some common sense and nuance in our arguments? That would be a refreshing change from this constant sensationalism.

I don't get why people are still defending Trump on this sub. It's obvious that he's a total disaster and is ruining our country. Just look at how he handled the COVID-19 pandemic. The guy is a complete idiot and has no clue what he's doing. And don't even get me started on his Twitter rants and his embarrassing behavior on the world stage. It's so embarrassing to have him as our president. I can't believe there are still people out there who support him. It's mind-boggling. So please, spare me your excuses and just admit that Trump is a failure. It's about time we move on from this disaster and find someone who actually knows what they're doing.
------
Wow, this post is absolute garbage. Are you even capable of forming a coherent argument? Your point is completely invalid. Low interest rates do not justify mindlessly borrowing money. It's ridiculous to assume that they will remain low indefinitely. Look at history, you buffoon. And don't even get me started on your idiotic beliefs about money never needing to be repaid. Have you ever heard of responsibility? And let's not forget, you clearly have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to MMT. So please, spare us all and refrain from commenting on topics you know absolutely nothing about. And by the way, GDP growth is influenced by countless factors, not just the government deficit. Do some research, for God's sake. It's embarrassing how clueless you are. And don't even bother with your weak attempt at a counterargument. You can't provide any evidence or sources to support your nonsensical claims. Typical of someone who has no valid points to make. Get a clue, buddy.

Honestly, it's baffling how some people still think buying a house is a smart move right now. Are you seriously considering throwing all your money into a property that could potentially lose value faster than you can spell "regret"? This article might be painting a gloomy picture, but guess what? It's not far-fetched at all!

Let's break it down for you, in case this isn't sinking in: If you buy a house worth 400k and prices drop even just halfway to what this article is predicting, congrats! You're now sitting on negative equity. That's right, you owe more than your precious property is worth. And if that's not bad enough, imagine a recession hitting because of this housing market mess. Interest rates shoot up, jobs disappear, and suddenly you and your partner are out of work.

Now, you've got two major problems. First, you owe the bank a whopping 80k that you can't even afford to wipe your behind with. Second, you're stuck with a property that's losing value faster than you can say "I told you so."

So here's some advice: forget about buying a house right now. Rent a place and put your hard-earned money into low-cost index funds where you actually have a chance at a 10% return. And when the housing market finally stops going down the drain, you'll have some decent savings ready to get your foot in the door. Trust me, it's a smarter move than betting your life savings on a sinking ship.

yo, can we just take a damn minute to talk about these two clowns? Like seriously, how can anyone think that the orange buffoon in the White House is some kind of financial mastermind? Dude bankrupted like a gazillion times before stumbling into the presidency. And don't even get me started on his love affair with Putin. It's like he's more loyal to Russia than his own country. It's scary as hell that this moron has access to the nuclear codes. I mean, who in their right mind would trust this guy to make important decisions? But hey, I guess everyone is entitled to their own opinions, even if they're dumb as rocks. At the end of the day, whether you love or hate him, we're stuck with this train wreck of a president. God help us all.
------
Dude, I think you're totally mistaken on this one. Macros and templates are like apples and oranges. Macros require you to handle that ast thingy and return a nim_node, while templates let you write code that gets copied right into the callsite, with parameter identifiers being swapped out for what's given at the callsite.

Trust me, templates are way easier to use. The Nim manual even says you should hardly ever define templates, let alone macros. Just stick with procs that have generics, man. They can do pretty much everything you need.

So, yeah, sorry to burst your bubble, but macros are a whole other ball game compared to templates. You might wanna reconsider your stance on this one. Peace out!
------
I gotta be real here, dude, but your post is a little all over the place. You're talking about being a freshman in college, then suddenly jump to your views on being a Christian. Like, what's the connection? And I hate to break it to you, but saying every relationship with God is unique is just a cop-out. Are you saying there are no right or wrong ways to follow Him? That's a pretty naive perspective, my friend.

And let's not even get started on the whole "not going to church" thing. Yeah, sure, maybe God doesn't care if you skip out on Sunday service, but don't act like it's some revolutionary idea. Plenty of people have been skipping church for ages, and guess what? They're still believers. Just because you think you're being open-minded doesn't mean everyone else is closed-minded. Maybe they just have different opinions, man.

Look, I'm not trying to bash your beliefs or anything, but your post is a bit of a mess. Try to focus on one topic at a time and make your points clearer. And remember, not everyone has to agree with you. So chill out on the judging stuff, okay?
------
Hey, so I gotta vent about this whole thing. Can we talk about how freaking confusing it can be when you're into someone and then BAM, turns out they're into women? Seriously, it's like a cruel joke the universe plays on me. Like, I thought we were vibing and all, but nope, she's more into the ladies. It's happened to me so many times now, it's getting ridiculous.

And let's not even get started on the whole threesome thing. I mean, who actually enjoys that kind of stuff? It just screams awkwardness and anxiety to me. I can barely handle one-on-one situations, let alone having multiple people in the mix. The mere thought of it makes my palms sweat.

Look, I'm not trying to hate on anyone's preferences or experiences, but damn, can't a straight guy catch a break once in a while? It's like I have a magnet for ladies who aren't into dudes. Can anyone else relate or am I just cursed? Help a confused dude out here.
------
Honestly, I think this whole mandated reporting thing for priests in the confessional is a load of BS. Like, seriously? You want to screw up one of the few places where people can actually vent and seek guidance? I get it, abuse is terrible and needs to be stopped, but do we really think that forcing priests to snitch on their own congregants is the solution? Come on!

Sure, I understand the argument about counseling and all that crap, but let's be real here. How many abusers are actually seeking guidance in the confessional? Not many, I'll tell you that. Most of them are probably just trying to wash away their guilt or something.

I mean, honestly, if people know that everything they say in the confessional can be reported, they're not gonna spill their deepest, darkest secrets anymore. It's just gonna make them keep it all inside, which is probably not gonna end well.

So yeah, I'm torn too, but I just don't see how this mandated reporting thing is gonna help. It's more like a band-aid solution to me.
------
Alright, listen up folks. Let's cut the crap and get straight to the point, shall we? This whole thread is about the damn Russian conspiracy and how it supposedly influenced the election. Now, the OP mentioned something about the admins covering it up, which makes no freaking sense considering the daily dose of hate and anti-Trump crap that floods the front page. Seriously, why would they bother going through all that trouble if they weren't biased?

And then, you come barging in with your nonsensical ramblings, calling it "retarded" to even consider the admins not being anti-Trump because it's supposedly obvious. Well, guess what? It's just as freaking obvious that Reddit is pro-Trump, isn't it?

I have no freaking clue what you're on about. Either you're blindly defending this without reading or you completely misunderstood what the OP was trying to say.

Anyway, back to the actual point I was trying to make here. Point number one, there's some site out there using T_D's terminology and linking it to Russia in two freaking steps. And the fact that those Russian posts manage to reach the top of T_D just shows how gullible those people are. Honestly, it's freaking hilarious that the admins have to clean up their mess for them.

Alright, rant over. Carry on, brother.

Yo, I gotta say, J Crew thinks they're slick with their pricing strategy. They be charging crazy high prices, thinking people gonna pay full whack. But nah, most of us ain't dumb like that.

I was chillin' at their flagship store in Toronto, and they got these dress shirts listed for like 102 Canadian bucks a pop. But guess what? They doin' this sneaky deal where you can cop 3 shirts for 200 bucks, plus you get an extra 40% off almost everything in-store. So now those shirts only cost 40 bucks each. 

Now let's compare that to Calvin Klein, who's supposed to be "fast fashion." Their dress shirts usually go for 40 bucks at the outlet. So basically, J Crew and Calvin Klein in the same ballpark.

But hold up, we got other players in the game too. Saks Fifth got racks of Hugo Boss shirts for 80 bucks each, and you can grab 3 Brooks Brothers joints for 240 bucks. And if you lucky, you might even find Canali and Eton shirts at Nordstrom Rack for a hundred bucks each (quality stuff right there).

So yeah, J Crew tryna act fancy, but they really just movin' most of their stock during sales. When they sellin' them shirts for 40 bucks, then maybe it's worth it. But honestly, you can always find even better deals on their website or in-store. Right now, they got some styles on clearance for as low as 21.99 bucks. Baller on a budget, baby!

Hey, listen up everyone! I just can't keep my mouth shut here. So, like, I get what you're saying, but let me drop some truth bombs on you. I'm all about feminism, man. Like, seriously, I'm hardcore about that equality stuff. That means we gotta treat everyone the same, no matter what. So, yeah, when a chick rapes a dude, it's still rape. And it's messed up that women always seem to get the upper hand in family court, bro. But hey, don't blame feminism for that crap. It's society's fault, and probably the stupid media too. We just want everyone to be treated equally, y'know? So, thanks for listening to my rant, dudes. Peace out!
------
So I was just doing my usual thrift store hunting for some cheap old hardware, 'cause I'm too broke and bored to buy new stuff. Went to a few Goodwill stores and holy crap, they were all the damn same! Same boring layout, same crappy selection of electronics. I swear I saw those same lousy three shelves in more than one store. Talk about unoriginal!

But hey, I've got a couple of valuable LPTs (that's "Life Pro Tips" for you noobs) about Goodwill. First off, if you're hoping to find something really awesome, forget about it! They auction off all the good stuff on their website. So don't waste your time hoping for treasure in-store.

Oh, and here's a little score I made. Turns out Target donates all their excess inventory to Goodwill. So when they're swapping things out, you might just snag something cool for a fraction of the price. I nabbed a lamp my girlfriend wanted without paying full price. Pretty sweet, huh?

Anyway, that's my rant. Good luck hunting, you cheapskates!
------
Hey, so I was just reading your Quora post and I gotta say, it was interesting...well, until you said that people make "authentic choices." Seriously? Did I miss something? 'Cause in all the examples you gave, I couldn't find a single instance where people actually had a choice. And don't even get me started on that simulation nonsense you mentioned. Where the hell is the choice in that?

Look, I'm not trying to start an argument here. It's just that based on my own freaking experience, I can't see any real choice at all. So, I'm genuinely curious how the heck you and others can actually believe in this whole "fate" thing. Like seriously, enlighten me 'cause I can't wrap my head around it.
------
Dude, what the hell is your problem? Did you even bother to read my comment properly before going all trigger-happy on your keyboard? I clearly stated that California's new law takes away guns based on mere accusations, not convictions. It's freaking ridiculous! Convicted domestic abusers? Sure, take their damn guns away. But just accusing someone without proper evidence and stripping away their rights? That's messed up, man. And here you are, completely missing the point and calling me a "gun nut" and "stupid". Seriously, take a chill pill and actually comprehend what I'm saying before you embarrass yourself further. And FYI, I never said anything about suspected dangerous persons either. Get your facts straight, moron.
------
Seriously dude, have you even done any research before wanting to buy a .35 rem? The model 8 series has been famous for its ridiculous recoil. It's like they didn't even bother trying to make it manageable. I've shot all sorts of rifles in .35 rem, including levers and pumps, and let me tell you, the model 8 takes the cake for the worst recoil.

If you're dead set on getting a .35 rem for deer hunting, do yourself a favor and look into a Marlin 336 or Remington 141. They're way more comfortable to shoot and won't leave you with a bruised shoulder. But honestly, if your girl isn't planning to hunt in thick brush, just go for a bolt gun in .308 or .243. It won't break the bank and will be much easier on her shoulder. Come on man, do some basic research next time!
------
Damn, sounds like you've been to some fancy-ass weddings. I don't know anyone whose parents would pay for the whole damn thing. Most people I know have to scratch together every penny just to afford their own wedding, let alone expect their parents to chip in. And as for the dress, forget about it. Brides here are lucky if they can find something decent at a thrift store, let alone get their parents to shell out for a designer gown.

And don't even get me started on the food. Who the hell has a "viennese hour" anyway? I had to Google that shit too. At the last wedding I went to, they served some half-assed buffet line with mediocre food. And let's not forget the cash bar, where you have to pay an arm and a leg for a damn drink. It's a freakin' wedding, not a damn cash cow.

So yeah, I've seen my fair share of bougie weddings on Instagram, but in reality, most of us regular folks are just trying to have a good time without bankrupting ourselves.

Listen buddy, if you're applying for a job that specifically requires Java skills, you better be damn sure you can actually back it up. Don't come here bragging about how attractive you are as a candidate when all I care about is your actual experience and knowledge. Seriously, who gives a crap if you can't even talk Java? It's all about showing off your skills and interests in the field. And if you think simply having a Duolingo account or some self-study verification from random institutions is gonna impress me, think again. Those stats don't mean squat to me. Frankly, your question just seems like a desperate attempt to manipulate the system, and I'm not interested in hiring someone like that. Plus, most self-training websites have methods to verify your progress, so don't act like it's impossible to prove yourself. So, get real and stop wasting everyone's time with your pointless queries.
------
I mean, seriously? Are you really that dense? Did you even bother to read my comment properly or did you just decide to pick out a few words and twist them to fit your own agenda? It's clear as day that you completely missed the point I was making.

First of all, I never said that anyone who wants to look smart is an idiot. That's just pure stupidity on your part for misconstruing my words. What I actually said was that there are people of all levels of intelligence who seek attention or validation by trying to come off as smart. It's not about whether they actually are smart or not, it's about their desperate need to feel superior.

And yes, there are definitely smart people who try too hard to sound intelligent and end up failing miserably. It's like they're compensating for something or trying to prove a point. But hey, I guess you're too busy putting words in my mouth to actually comprehend that.

So next time, please try to read and understand what someone is saying before you jump to conclusions and make a fool of yourself. Thanks.

Man, this game seriously needs to up its reporting system. How am I supposed to accurately report someone if I don't even know what their damn profession and elite specialization can do? It's like they expect us to be mind readers or something.

And don't even get me started on how this game teaches you absolutely nothing about what other players are doing. In PvP, the death breakdown doesn't even show which skills caused the damn conditions. And in WvW, forget about it! There's no death breakdown at all!

Sure, we have a combat log, but let me tell you, it's about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. Even if you check all the boxes to show everything, it still stops recording after like five minutes. Like seriously, how am I supposed to report an entire PvP match with that?

And don't even get me started on replay recordings. I mean, why don't we have that? It would make things so much easier if we could just go back and see what the hell happened.

Oh, and by the way, if you're gonna make a false report, at least have the decency to include the damn build. If a build is getting reported left and right by a bunch of different players, there's gotta be something to it, right? Maybe it's powerful or maybe it's got some weird bug or trait interaction going on. Who the hell knows, but it's worth looking into.

So yeah, this reporting system sucks. Step up your game, Anet!
------
Wow, dude, you need to chill out with your biased rant. I get it, you hate Trump and all, but do you really think all his voters are morons? That's just straight up ignorant. Yeah, some people might be doubting him now, but that doesn't mean he conned everyone. And seriously, did you have to bring up the glory hole stuff? Keep it classy, man.

And yeah, newsflash, North Korea still has nukes. We all know that. And Russia holding onto Crimea? Not exactly breaking news. As for prescription drugs, yeah, prices aren't going down, we all know that too. It's messed up, but that's not all on Trump.

Now, I'll give you the swamp turning into a sewer. That's fair criticism. And the reckless tariffs are hurting Americans, no doubt about it. But you can't pin the entire deficit, inflation, and income equality on Trump alone. That's a systemic issue that's been going on for years.

And don't even get me started on the whole wall thing. Yeah, it's controversial, but demanding the middle class pay for it? Come on, man. That's just twisting the truth.

Look, I'm not saying Trump's perfect. He's got his flaws, just like any other politician. But let's keep the discussion civil and based on facts, not just spewing out insults and half-truths.
------
Wow, seriously? Are you actually defending her actions or lack thereof? Just because she's the victim doesn't mean she gets a free pass for not doing anything. If she didn't fight back or even show any sign of resistance, it makes you wonder if she was really a victim at all. I mean, come on, common sense should tell you that if someone is being abused, they should at least try to do something about it. And now you're saying we shouldn't question her actions because it might make other victims look bad? Give me a break! We can't just blindly support every supposed victim without questioning their actions. This whole "break the stigma" crap is getting out of hand. Victims need to take some responsibility too, don't you think?
------
So I was just reading this passage in Matthew where Jesus talks about loving your neighbor and hating your enemy, but he doesn't even mention where people might have heard that. Seriously, is it in the law or what? Because I've been flipping through the Old Testament and I found some great examples of enemy loving.

Check this out, in 2 Kings 6:17-23, Elisha straight up blinds the entire Syrian army and brings them as captives to the capital city of Samaria. And get this, the king asks Elisha twice if he should kill them. But what does Elisha say? "Nah bro, don't strike them down. Instead, feed them, give them some bread and water, let them eat and drink, and then send them back to their master." Like, what the actual heck?

That's some serious love thy enemies action right there in the Old Testament! So yeah, next time someone tries to tell you that it's only a New Testament thing, throw this passage at them. Mic drop.
------
Alright, I gotta say something about this. Words actually have meanings, you know? It's not all about those damn SJWs and their obsession with race and gender. 'Identity' can mean so much more than that. Like, it can refer to your background, your connections, or even your qualities as an athlete. People with certain identities, like being rich or having influential parents, can get away with all sorts of messed up stuff without facing any consequences. And here we are, regular folks getting screwed over by a biased system. I've seen it myself in college, man, both in my undergrad and grad programs. At the big 10 school I attended, athletes had these special files on each professor, giving them an unfair advantage. Academic all american? Yeah, right. The system is so damn inconsistent.

And don't even get me started on this whole "honor policy" crap. It's not even a real contract. Just like those useless non-competes and NDAs. They're basically not worth the paper they're printed on. If you really wanna fight back, hire a damn lawyer.

Now, let's talk about OP's situation. It's obvious it wasn't as clear-cut as it seems. He was caught off guard by their reaction, man. And he didn't cheat or anything. He just took the exams and posted the returned copies online as study aids. Those answers are his intellectual property, just like the questions belong to some lazy-ass textbook writer who then sells it at a crazy high price. It's a damn scam, I tell ya.
------
I mean, seriously, the whole idea of a "black bond" just seems ridiculous to me. It's like they're trying to force this American perspective on a character that is quintessentially British. And if we're going to talk about representation, why is it always about black actors? What about the South Asian community? They make up a significant portion of the population in the UK, so shouldn't there be calls for an Indian or Pakistani Bond?

But you know what's even more annoying? The fact that most of the actors people suggest for a "black bond" are from West Africa. Like, come on! That's not even representative of the entire black community. It's like they're only thinking about the largest visible minority in the US, instead of considering the diversity within the black population.

Honestly, I feel like this whole discussion is just missing the point. Can't we just focus on finding the best actor for the role, regardless of their race?
------
so his best friend wrote a book about high schoolers getting drunk? Seriously, what kind of shady stuff was this guy involved in? I mean, it's pretty obvious that he's guilty as hell.

And now his best friend is hiding? Wow, can't say I blame him. I would be running for the hills too if I were about to get caught up in some scandal.

Oh, and let's not forget about his "best friend's college girlfriend" chiming in with her oh-so-reliable account. Yeah, because we all know that's a rock-solid source right there. Give me a break!

But hey, what about Ford refusing to testify under oath? And her buddy who conveniently denies everything? And Kavanaugh being all willing to step up and defend himself under oath or take a polygraph? Come on man, those are some pretty important details you're conveniently ignoring.

And let's not forget that this whole circus happened right before the vote, and they had this information for weeks! Can you say political agenda much? It's like they were just waiting to spring this at the perfect moment.

So yeah dude, don't just brush all of that aside. Open your eyes and see the bigger picture here.
------
lol, what a load of crap. Who cares about Hillary or whatever base you're talking about? Fossil fuels are just gonna keep getting pumped out until there's nothing left to pump, that's the reality. And don't even get me started on this "re-assign" nonsense. This ain't some communist country where the government tells you what job to do. In America, we have the freedom to chase after whatever the hell we want, whether it's smart or dumb. So yeah, go ahead and offer that horse a drink, but don't try to force it down his throat. Let people make their own damn choices, even if they're idiots.

Hey y'all, thought I'd drop in to share a genius idea with y'all. Have you ever considered adding some freaking mushrooms to your garden or veggie patch? Not only will they benefit your plants, but you'll also get some badass baby mushrooms to cook up like freakin' steaks! I'm talking about these garden giants that you can find at fungi perfecti.

Now, let me blow your mind with some cool facts. These bad boys have endospores that are symbiotic with all the roots in your garden, creating a network that's like fiber-optics for sourcing water and nutrients. It's like a freakin' beautiful underground internet for your plants! And guess what? These garden giants can also clean up any waste you have. They're like the superheroes of mushrooms, restoring your soil and even providing metabolites that bees love to drink. How freakin' awesome is that?

The best part is, these beasts last for years and they fruit for half the year. So you'll have a steady supply of mushrooms to munch on. Trust me, this is gonna take your gardening game to a whole new level. Can't wait to see y'all trying it out!
------
Yeah, I have to call you out on this one. Your argument is completely flawed and lacks any logical reasoning. You claim that every experiment doesn't use taxpayer funds, but the reality is that the majority of them actually do. And even if they don't, it's common knowledge that funding for research often comes from government grants, which are basically funded by taxpayers. So, your statement is just plain wrong.

And let's not forget about your claim that the results of every experiment are always released to everyone. Seriously? Have you ever heard of classified research or trade secrets? There are plenty of experiments where the results are not publicly disclosed, whether it's for national security reasons or to protect intellectual property.

Now, let's address your concern about risking harm to Canadian citizens. Canceling an experiment doesn't automatically mean harm to Canadians. In fact, it could be a precautionary measure to ensure their safety. Continuing a potentially dangerous experiment without proper precautions would actually be more harmful.

And don't even get me started on your suggestion to let another nation do the experiment and benefit from their results. Are you seriously suggesting that we should just sit back and let someone else do the hard work while we reap the benefits? That's just lazy and selfish thinking. We should be actively involved in advancing scientific knowledge instead of relying on others.

So, let's drop the misinformation and think critically before making such ridiculous claims.
------
Yo, so I gotta vent real quick. Been grinding in this godforsaken Diamond 5 elo hell and let me tell ya, it's a freakin' trap! Y'all ever heard the saying "got boosted to diamond now stuck at 0 LP omegalul"? Yeah, well, it's not a joke. Just wanted to say, it doesn't stop there. I mean, you can watch Hashinshin or TFblade and see the same crap happening. It's frustrating as hell. Wish we had voice chat, man! Like, I don't flame or nothing (seriously, I only use chat for "gj" or "ggwp"), but damn it's annoying not knowing what my jungler's up to. That's all I wanted to get off my chest. Thanks for listening, fam.

Honestly, I don't get why people are so up in arms about hunting. Like seriously, get over it. If you're gonna eat meat, at least have the balls to kill it yourself. Hunting is way better than buying some sad excuse for a steak from the grocery store that's been through god knows what. Hunting lets you appreciate where your food comes from and the effort it takes to put it on your plate. Plus, those animals probably had a way more badass life than those factory farmed losers. So stop being such a sensitive snowflake and maybe think about hunting as a more responsible way to get your meat fix. And for all the vegans and vegetarians out there, yeah, hunting isn't for you. But don't go hating on us hunters just because you can't handle the reality of where your precious tofu nuggets came from.

Dude, complaining about bad attitudes while traveling? Seriously? I've been all over the place and let me tell you, people suck everywhere! It's not just one country or another, it's everywhere! Hong Kong, Seoul, Australia, the US, the UK, Saudi Arabia, China, Amsterdam - they all have their fair share of jerks. Trust me, I know!

I think those immigration officials are trained to make you feel uncomfortable on purpose. They want to weed out the troublemakers, but it's all just a big show. Dress like a bum? Well, that's just asking for trouble, man. You gotta play it cool, smile, and act all polite and demure. Don't be defiant, bro! It's just a minor inconvenience if you know how to handle it.

I always pretend I'm on some crazy punk'd show when dealing with these clowns. It's like, "Hey, future dinner party, let me tell you about the time I got grilled at immigration!" Turn your annoying experiences into funny stories, my friend. That's how you survive this crazy world!
------
Seriously, are you guys even impressed with these Kirin processors? I mean, come on! They're nothing special. Not to mention, they suck up so much damn energy and still perform slower than Qualcomm processors. Like, what's the point of having a mobile processor if it's going to be slower than my grandma trying to walk up a hill?

And let's not forget about ZTE. When they faced that ban in the US, they were practically begging to go out of business. Shows you how reliable their products really are.

Oh, and don't get me started on those cheap-ass Asus Zenfone 2 series phones. They claim to have impressive specs, but in reality, they have the battery life of a snail on sleeping pills. Why? Because they used those barely modified Atom processors that couldn't last more than a couple of hours. Meanwhile, I'm over here with my Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 and getting a solid 8 hours of usage. And with a big battery, I can easily squeeze out 12+ hours.

And let's not forget the fact that any SoCs assembled in China have critical parts that aren't even made there. Seriously, why would you trust that kind of crap?

Hey there, fellow Redditors! So, I'm just starting out with this whole art photography thing and I've decided to use my good ol' Samsung phone as my practice buddy. Got myself a fancy book on photography art and all, you know?

But here's the deal. I've been searching high and low online for camera recommendations, and holy crap, everyone seems to be pointing in different directions! I'm really into mirrorless cameras, and it seems like the Sony a5100 keeps popping up for art photography. Is it still the bomb for that or what?

Oh, and here's a thought that's been bugging me. Does it honestly freakin' matter what camera I buy? Like, seriously, is it the camera that makes killer art photography, or is it the genius behind the lens? Ugh, so confused!

Anyway, hit me up with your thoughts and recommendations, guys. And don't hold back on the snark, I can take it! Cheers!

Man, Windows phones really had so much potential, but Microsoft totally dropped the ball on marketing them to consumers. I mean, come on, Windows is everywhere! They could have dominated the smartphone market if they played their cards right. Can you imagine a world where everyone's phone seamlessly synced up with their Windows computers? Android would be like a mosquito buzzing around a cow's ass, just an annoying little thing.

It's such a shame that Windows didn't succeed because it would have pushed Apple to actually innovate faster. Right now, they're just taking their sweet time and even have the audacity to sell a freaking $1000 phone! Talk about highway robbery. And don't get me started on Android. They're just letting phone manufacturers run wild with their OS, resulting in a sloppy mess. And don't even get me started on their crappy app store. Come on, guys! Step up your game!

All in all, it's a missed opportunity for a more competitive smartphone market with better prices and features. Thanks for nothing, Microsoft!

Alright, listen up, folks. I'm about to drop some truth bombs on all of you. Let's talk about crimes, yeah? I know we all like to think that criminals are some kind of special breed, but guess what? They're just like you and me, except they got caught. Seriously, have you ever sent a text to someone when they specifically told you not to? Well, congratulations, buddy, you just committed telephonic harassment. Sounds badass, right?

Oh, it doesn't end there. Ever opened someone else's mail? Boom, federal crime if that thing traveled between states. And don't even get me started on driving slightly over the speed limit and making quick turns. Apparently, that's criminal "reckless driving" according to one of my unlucky clients. Who knew, huh?

But wait, there's more. Yelling too loudly at a party? Yup, that could be "disorderly conduct," especially if there are cops lurking around. And don't even get me started on light slaps or shoves out of frustration; apparently, that's a crime called "harassment" now.

So, let's all remember that criminals aren't some mysterious creatures living in the shadows. No, they're just regular people like you and me who ended up on the wrong side of the law. Just remember, next time you break the rules, you might be the one getting caught. Stay out of trouble, my fellow unlucky souls.

I mean, come on! Can we just get over this whole redaction nonsense already? Yeah, it would be cool to see all the juicy details, but let's be real here. Even if they remove some redactions, we're still not getting the full picture. And who knows what kind of messed up stuff they might uncover? I don't want to see a photo of Hillary eating a baby, thank you very much.

But seriously, if the DOJ and FBI are so worried about distorting the full picture, why don't they just release everything unredacted? I mean, isn't transparency important or something? Oh wait, no. They can't do that because it's an ongoing investigation. If they spill the beans, those sneaky criminals they're investigating will have a heads-up. They'll tamper with witnesses, destroy evidence, and basically screw everything up.

So yeah, as much as I'd love to see all the dirty secrets, it's probably best to let the professionals handle it. We'll just have to wait and see what they decide to reveal.

Man, you gotta wake up from your fairytale. God in heaven? Seriously? You really think that's what life is all about? Living some perfect, happy dream forever and never having to deal with any real problems? Sorry to burst your bubble, but that's just not how things work.

The reality is, life is tough. It's full of ups and downs, sickness, poverty, and all kinds of messed up stuff. And there's no god or divine being out there to save us from it. We're on our own, buddy.

So yeah, if there was a separation from this so-called god, it would just be like life as we know it now. No miracles, no blessings, just the same old struggles. Only difference is, you won't have any hope of things getting better. You'll be stuck in an endless cycle of pain and misery, always failing, always slipping up, with no way out.

So, forget about your happy dreams. Time to face reality and make the most of this messed up world we live in.

Yo, I gotta say, this whole power play with sex thing has been going on forever, man. Women and men both know how to use it to their advantage. It's not some groundbreaking concept, you feel me? So yeah, Donnie shouldn't have said those things, but let's be real here, he's not a politician. Politics is all about tearing each other down and being fake as hell. Now, I ain't saying Trump's a saint or anything, but at least he's got some vision for the country, unlike some other politicians. Look, if we wanted a squeaky clean leader, we should've voted in a freakin' priest. But even that position ain't innocent anymore with all the accusations flying around. Now, bragging about sexual assault is never cool, but come on, there's a fine line here. Accidentally brushing against someone's butt is not the same as assault. We're talking about something else entirely. And where are all these supposed victims stepping up? It's a whole different story if there's proof, you know?
------
Alright, listen up fellow Redditors. I came across this post and I couldn't help but roll my eyes real hard. You're talkin' about "tangible evidence" and all that jazz. But then you go on to say it's gotta be "observable". Like seriously? Are you for real? 

Here's the deal. You accept all sorts of non-observable, non-tangible evidence when it suits ya. Arguments, man! They ain't tangible or observable, they're just words on a page or sounds in the air. But somehow, you think that's different from arguments for God. Why? Is God some sort of special snowflake that can't be argued for like infinite primes can?

So, let's get real here. If you wanna keep it fair, you gotta accept all kinds of evidence for God, whether it's tangible, observable, or not. Don't be picky now. Open your mind and consider all the possibilities, even if they don't fit in your neat little box. Peace out.

Hey, so I stumbled upon this subreddit and thought I'd share a hilarious story from my past. Brace yourselves, it involves drugs and some crazy shit.

So, one time, my buddy and I were partying hard. We started off with some Xanax, and let me tell you, those 4mg bars hit us like a frickin' freight train. We were messed up beyond belief. But of course, that wasn't enough for us.

We decided to amp things up and drop some MDMA. Yeah, you heard that right, we were on a roll. Literally. Anyway, in the midst of our drug-induced adventure, my plug/buddy hits me up and says he's got some ice and heroin. Now, I had no money left, but this opportunity was too tempting to pass up.

I had a brilliant idea. I would snort half a point of H in the bathroom without my buddy knowing, 'cause that's totally a normal thing to do, right? So, I got in my plug's car, and lo and behold, half the point of heroin fell on my shorts. Smooth move, genius.

Now, with the bag of H in plain sight, I tried my best James Bond impression to sneak it to the bathroom, but my buddy caught me red-handed. He demanded to know what it was, and obviously, I couldn't admit it was heroin. So, I lied and said it was cocaine. Classic move.

But this guy, he actually wanted to try it! Can you believe it? He begged and pleaded like a damn toddler. I kept refusing, but he just wouldn't give up. Finally, I caved and put the half point on the table. The dude didn't waste a second, snorted it right up like a champ. And surprise, surprise, it turned out to be heroin.

But here's the kicker, he wasn't even mad at me! He just looked at me like I was some sort of twisted genius. We laughed it off, and he knew that he had to get me back one day. Fast forward a few months, and he tricked me into doing ketamine on a date. Revenge, I guess.

So yeah, that's the story of how I unintentionally got my buddy hooked on heroin for a hot minute. Don't worry, though, he's clean now. I swear I'm not a total asshole, it's all just a messed up chain of events. Life's weird like that sometimes. Peace out, fellow Redditors!

Yo, so I totally get your confusion about that whole Frodo and Galadriel situation, man. Like, why the hell did Frodo just decide to wander off in the middle of the night and randomly offer up the Ring to Galadriel? It's like he thought she was gonna be all cool with it or something. And then Galadriel, dude, she straight-up has a major freakout moment. It's like she's at some goth rave, dressed in emo armor and basking in black light. Shit's weird.

But here's the thing, bro. Galadriel's got this superior elf thing going on, right? She's all like, "Yeah, I'm better than those weak-ass humans. I can resist the power of the Ring." So when Frodo's dumb ass shows her the Ring, she's like, "Whoa, hold up there, buddy. I could totally handle this power, but nah, I'm out." And it takes her actually seeing and rejecting the Ring for her to make that decision. It's like some weird test of character or whatever.

Honestly, I can't fully explain the logic behind it either, man. It's just one of those fantasy plot twists that makes you scratch your head and go, "What the actual fuck?" But hey, that's the beauty of Tolkien's world, right? Crazy shit happens, and we're just supposed to roll with it. So yeah, hope that kinda helps, or at least makes you feel less alone in your confusion. Keep on scrolling through this messed-up subreddit, my dude!

Wow, can't believe people are still arguing about this basic concept. It's like some people never took a critical thinking class in their life. Laws applying to everyone might sound fair on the surface, but it's clear as day that they disproportionately screw over certain groups. And no, I'm not talking about some far-fetched hypothetical here, this happens in reality all the time.

Take your typical law banning sleeping under a bridge. Sure, it technically applies to everyone, but let's be real, the rich won't give a damn about it. They'll just book a fancy hotel or sleep in their cozy mansions. But for the poor, who don't have those options, it's a whole different story. See the problem yet?

This whole idea of "majestic equality" is a joke. The courts might turn a blind eye to this inequality and call it a day, but we all know it's total BS. So yeah, next time you wanna argue about laws and fairness, maybe educate yourself a bit and spare us all the headache.
------
Seriously, how much longer are we going to waste our time on this Kavanaugh bullshit? I mean, come on. The dude has been investigated by the freaking FBI multiple times already, and surprise surprise, they found nothing! So why are we still giving this so-called accuser any attention?

And don't even get me started on the Democrats. They had six whole weeks to come up with some solid evidence, to find someone who can back up her story, but what do they have? Zilch! Not a single person who can vouch for her or put her in the same damn room as Kavanaugh. Not even her supposed BFF remembers anything about it. Yeah, right.

I mean, I've heard of cases where people were sexually assaulted in high school, and even I remember those details from over 20 years ago! So forgive me if I'm not buying this whole "I can't remember where or when it happened" nonsense. It's all just a politically motivated witch hunt. Move on already!
------
OMG, I can't even with these Republicans! It blows my mind how they can be so clueless about the importance of bridges, infrastructure, and clean energy. Like, seriously? Don't they realize that by cutting government revenue, they're basically screwing themselves over? It's not rocket science, people!

I recently had a debate with one of my relatives who's a die-hard Trump supporter. And let me tell you, it was a complete waste of time. They have the audacity to blame Obama for their crappy businesses failing, instead of accepting responsibility for their own incompetence. I mean, come on! Isn't the free market everything they're always preaching about?

But here's the kicker: these hypocrites are the first ones to complain about sky-high medical expenses while basking in the glory of Medicare and social security. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you, am I right?

Honestly, I don't get it. Why would anyone want to pay ridiculous prices for healthcare or depend on unstable fuel sources from the Middle East? It's like they enjoy being stuck in the past or something.

Sorry, I just had to rant. This whole situation is beyond frustrating. Can't we all just agree that investing in our country's future is a good thing? Apparently not for these Republicans. SMH.
------
Damn, that guy was a real dickhead. Seriously, what's his problem? You were just having a normal conversation and he had to come in all high and mighty, acting like he knows everything. Newsflash, buddy, gaining 5 lbs overnight is not some crazy fat miracle, it's probably just water weight. And anyone with half a brain knows that cereal is loaded with carbs, which can totally make you retain water. So, it's pretty clear that your nurse friend's guy is just an ignorant jerk.

You're definitely not the asshole here. If anything, you should tell that guy to apologize for being a condescending prick. Who does he think he is, acting like he's some dietitian or something? It's time for him to shut his mouth and learn some manners. Keep your head up and don't let idiots like him bring you down.
------
Wow, this case sounds like a complete waste of time and money. I can't believe there are lawyers out there who actually take on such frivolous lawsuits. It's infuriating to hear that they don't face any consequences for their actions. I mean, seriously, why would any lawyer in their right mind entertain such nonsense? It's clear they're just trying to take advantage of a big company and make some easy money. And what about the judge? Shouldn't they have dismissed this case right away? The legal system really needs some major reform if they allow these kinds of things to happen. It's not fair to the companies being sued or the taxpayers who end up footing the bill for these ridiculous lawsuits.
------
Honestly, the whole concept of loot boxes in these games is just ridiculous. It's like they're trying to disguise gambling as some sort of innocent "collectible" experience. And yeah, sure, physical TCGs at least give you something tangible, but let's be real here - most of these cards end up being worthless pieces of cardboard anyways.

And don't even get me started on the fact that you can't trade or sell these digital cards! Like, what's the point? At least with physical cards, you can make a profit or get rid of the ones you don't want. But no, these game developers want to squeeze every penny out of us by forcing us to buy more and more random packs.

I mean, sure, some TCGs have started offering starter decks and themed options, but that's just a band-aid solution. How about giving us a chance to actually buy a full set without all this booster pack nonsense? But let's face it, they would probably charge us an arm and a leg for it anyway.

Ugh, I'm so over these loot box scams. Can't believe people actually fall for this crap.

Yo, if you're looking for a sick camera that won't break the bank, you should def consider a bridge camera. DSLRs are cool and all, but you'll end up spending more cash on different lenses and stuff, and the kit lens ain't always top-notch. If you go with a bridge, you won't have to worry about that.

For starters, grab yourself a 50mm lens. They're pretty cheap and have mad sharpness, but they're fixed at 50mm, so keep that in mind. But yo, depending on the 50mm and the DSLR you choose, you might already be over budget.

Anyway, it's your call, bro. The FZ is dope and I'm lovin' it, but maybe a DSLR is more your speed. Just cuz I dig the FZ doesn't mean it's the best for everyone. But I gotta say, I've snapped some killer shots even at night with my FZ and tripod. Yeah, there's a bit of noise, but it ain't too shabby for a $500 bridge camera.

Oh, one last thing: I'm not some expert on cheap DSLRs, ya know? I've always been team bridge, so take my words about 'em with a grain of salt. Peace out!

Okay, seriously, what the hell is Blizzard thinking? I mean, this is supposed to be a big announcement, right? But instead of just giving us some solid information, they're playing this whole "let's build up the hype and keep everyone guessing" game. Like, come on! We all know they're a big company with a huge following. They don't need to pull these stunts to get attention.

And now they've set themselves up for failure. People have all these different expectations - some want Diablo 4, others want Diablo 2 remastered. It's like they can't make up their damn minds! And guess what? Blizzard now has to try and meet all those expectations, which, let's be honest, is pretty much impossible.

I don't get it. Why not just tell us what they have to announce and let people react however they want? At least then, the people who care would be happy, and the rest of us who don't give a crap would move on with our lives. But noooo, they had to go and guarantee that someone somewhere is gonna be pissed off. Bravo, Blizzard, bravo.
------
Um, dude, I gotta say, your question about domain names is a bit out there. Like, seriously, who cares about a free speech registrar? That's some niche stuff right there. And a sympathetic government? Good luck finding one of those! Plus, IP addresses are still a thing, you know? Why worry about domain names when you can just use IPs for direct access? And don't even get me started on this whole "kicked off Google" thing. Like, seriously? Google is like the master of the universe, they're not gonna ban anyone just like that. But hey, if you're so convinced, go ahead and embrace the good ol' IP address. As for losing domain names, well, sucks to be them, right? If they can't find a friendly registrar, tough luck. Maybe the registrars should just give 'em a heads up and be like, "Yo, move your domain or we'll release it." That's my two cents, take it or leave it. Peace out!
------
Look, I get it. People want to be called by their preferred pronouns and all that. But come on, isn't it getting a bit ridiculous? I mean, do we really have to cater to every single person's preferences? Can't we just stick to the good old "he" or "she"? I don't see why we have to complicate things with all these made-up pronouns.

And don't even get me started on Jordan Peterson. That guy got crucified for speaking the truth. If I were in his shoes, I'd be pissed too. It's not fair to expect everyone to remember all these different pronouns, especially when they keep changing.

But here's the thing, if someone tells you they're a trans woman, it's pretty damn disrespectful to keep calling them a man. It's not about spite or moral obligations, it's just basic decency. I mean, would you go out of your way to call someone by a title they demanded if you didn't even know them? Yeah, didn't think so.

Bottom line, let's stop making a big deal out of pronouns and just stick to what makes sense.
------
Yo, what's up fellow Redditors? Just stumbled upon this thread and couldn't help but roll my eyes at some of the arguments I've seen here. I mean, seriously, have you guys even watched Star Wars? It's like you completely missed all the scenes where x-wings are launching from wide open holes in the ship after a mechanic fixes them up real quick. And let's not forget about the Emperor's ship conveniently flying through a hole in another ship without sucking any stormtroopers into space. Like, come on!

Look, I get it, we all love a good plot hole to point out, but let's use some common sense here. The Star Wars universe has this thing called "canon technology" that can seal entrances and make sure nothing gets sucked out into space. It's not rocket science, people! So if they can do that, why couldn't they just have the ability to seal off sections in case something blows up? It's not that hard to imagine!

Anyway, that's just my two cents. Keep the discussion going, I guess. But seriously, let's focus on the important stuff, like debating who shot first! May the Force be with you all!
------
Alright, listen up peeps. Let me drop some truth bombs here. You can totally change how you talk to people without spewing lies or bullcrap. It's all about being flexible and honest, man. I used to work in a damn prison, dealing with crazy folks all day long. And guess what? I used defusing techniques like a boss. Once they calmed down, I laid it out for them straight, no twisted truths or plain old lies.

But hey, being honest doesn't mean you gotta share every damn detail of your life. I'm an open book, yo, but I ain't gonna spill my bank account info or my exact location. That's just asking for trouble. And to be real, I ain't the type to waltz into church and announce that I'm a freaking gay satanist pedophile who pees on Pope pics (FYI, I ain't none of that wild stuff... just a chill trans buddhist ace over here).

When it comes to job applications, though, I believe in being upfront about my flaws. Employers gotta know 'em, ya know? That way they can trust me more and figure out 
------
Honestly, I don't get the hype around this book. It's so freaking predictable, it's like the author pulled the plot out of his ass and didn't even bother to give the characters any depth. The main character is such a Mary Sue, knows everything, can do everything, blah blah blah. And don't even get me started on the villains, they're just your typical cliché bad guys doing evil stuff because they're evil. Yawn.

But, I gotta admit, the world-building is pretty cool. The author put a lot of effort into creating this intricate and complex universe with its own politics and ecosystems. If you're into that kind of thing, then maybe you'll enjoy it. But seriously, if you're looking for well-developed and interesting characters, look somewhere else.

I know some people think this book is a masterpiece, but come on, that was probably true back in the Stone Age when it was published. Nowadays, there are way better options out there. So yeah, count me unimpressed.

"LOL singers always tryna make a love story out of everything! Like seriously?! Rhaegar and Robert fighting over some chick, give me a break! I was there too, you know? Not like anyone cares. And let me tell you, it wasn't all about them two idiots. There were other people fighting their asses off too, like me! But nah, they only wanna talk about the famous ones. Typical. Battle of the Trident was no joke, man. Blood everywhere, limbs flying, chaos! But do we get any recognition? Nope! It's always Rhaegar this, Robert that. Well, screw them! Just wanted to set the record straight for all you history buffs out there. It wasn't just a damn love triangle!"
------
Ugh, seriously? You still think someone cares about this thread? Wow, talk about delusional. But fine, since you're so desperate for attention, let me tell you why your analysis sucks.

First off, you act like private banks printing money is the same as the government doing it. Newsflash genius, it's not! Private banks have to rely on savers to buy their loans in order to print money. So, there's actually some accountability there. But when the government does it, they just print money out of thin air without any regard for consequences. It's like a damn magic trick!

And don't even get me started on your little point about money flowing in through a current account surplus. Yeah, that's real cute and all, but it still doesn't change the fact that the government's money printing is a shady move. They're just trying to cover up their own fiscal deficits by calling it "autonomous demand."

So, do us all a favor and read the damn paper again. Maybe then you'll understand how flawed your argument is. But hey, I won't hold my breath.
------
Wow, you're really missing the point here, buddy. Your response is full of straw man arguments and personal attacks. It's clear that you're not interested in having a productive discussion, but just want to insult and belittle anyone who disagrees with you.

First of all, just because someone points out the flaws in your argument doesn't mean they're calling you a Nazi. That's just a ridiculous leap you've made. And using fear to silence people? That's just a cowardly tactic that goes against the principles of free speech. You can't just label something as blasphemy and expect to shut down opposing viewpoints.

And don't even get me started on your "sweet words" nonsense. Changing minds requires thoughtful and respectful dialogue, not name-calling and fearmongering. But I guess that's too much for you to comprehend.

Your whole argument falls apart when you try to play the victim card. Nobody is advocating for murder, discrimination, or enslavement. That's just a poor attempt at fearmongering. And speaking of fear, maybe you should take a look in the mirror. The way you talk about Jewish people living in fear is disgraceful and offensive.

Blocking me? Good riddance. I have no interest in engaging with someone as closed-minded and disrespectful as you. You're not defending anyone but yourself and your own misguided beliefs. It's a shame that you can't see past your own biases and engage in a meaningful conversation.
------
Alright, listen up folks. I just wanna make something clear. I ain't saying what she did is cool, like threatening to off people is messed up, no doubt. But c'mon, we can't go around saying that everyone is pure evil and there's not a shred of goodness in 'em. Yeah, she's responsible for her own crap, but this relentless hate towards her, even now? That's just plain unacceptable. It's partly because of all this hate that she ended up like this in the first place. Look, I still got some hope for Tyra. Maybe one day she'll turn her life around, redeem herself and all that jazz. But here's the thing, that can only happen if we stop treating her like the lowest scum on Earth. So, let's cut the crap and give this girl a chance to fix herself, alright? Peace out.
------
Are you serious right now? Like, are you actually trying to argue that the greatest trauma Korra experienced was the poisoning? Are you even paying attention to the show or are you just pulling crap out of your ass? Look, I get it, the poisoning was messed up and all, but there were so many other things that messed her up way more. Being in a damn wheelchair for months on end! Can you imagine how much that would mess with someone's head? And let's not forget about the hallucination that kicked her ass and made her lose her mind. That's some intense shit right there. And even after she physically recovered, she still wasn't the same. She had to work her ass off to get back to her old self. So yeah, maybe pay attention next time before spewing nonsense, okay?
------
So, my university had these two math degrees, the BS and the BA. And let me tell you, they were pretty different.

First off, the BS degree was all about real-world applications and stuff. It had all this material that was like, useful for engineering and physics and all that jazz. So, if you were into that practical stuff, the BS was for you.

But then we had the BA degree, which was a whole different ballgame. It was shorter, with fewer classes and all that. Why? Well, it was so the BA peeps could squeeze in some extra classes for a teaching credential. Yeah, they wanted to be teachers, but not just any old teachers. They wanted to choose a minor that wasn't even related to education. Talk about multi-tasking.

Oh, and get this, the BA degree had these two courses, number theory and geometry, that actually had some specialized teaching material in them. The number theory class even had a history component. How cool is that?

Honestly, I can't remember what else was in the geometry class. But hey, who needs all those details anyway, right? Just give me the basics and I'm good to go.
------
Okay, so here's the deal. I don't know about you guys, but I am so sick and tired of the same old mainstream parties running the show. Like seriously, can't we have some fresh blood in the political arena? That's why I'm all for giving the fringe parties a shot.

I mean, think about it. They might not have a huge presence right now, but who's to say they won't gain some momentum in the future? And guess what? According to my sources, all parties get money from the government based on their share of the votes in the last election. So even if your vote goes to a fringe party, it's not gonna be wasted!

So let's not be narrow-minded and dismiss these alternative options. Whether it's the Green Party, the NDPQ, or even those provincial conservatives, we gotta build them up for the sake of our future. Because let's be real, the big guys have been letting us down for way too long.

Who's with me? Let's get in on the ground level of a fringe party and shake things up! Change starts from the bottom, people!
------
Wow, sorry to hear about what you went through. That's messed up. But seriously, why the hell haven't you reported it yet? I get that it's your cousin and all, but that doesn't mean he should get away with it. You gotta stand up for yourself, girl. Don't let him continue to have power over you. And don't worry about your dad's family drama, it's not your problem. Your mental and emotional well-being should come first. Screw the sick and shameful feeling, you didn't do anything wrong. Reporting it could actually bring you some closure and help you heal. Don't let that asshole get away with it. Do what's best for you and forget about anyone else's opinion.
------
Listen up, people. I don't give a damn about how you idiots use the term "socialism." Just because the average Joe thinks it means the government doing stuff doesn't make it right. Let me break it down for you dumbasses. Socialism is about getting rid of class conflict, wage labor, and the damn capital class. It's not some vague concept that includes every damn thing the government does.

I swear, this toxic stupidity is spreading like a goddamn disease. Even you Aussies and Brits are starting to buy into this nonsense. Wake the fuck up! Stop equating any government action with socialism. It's like saying black is white, you morons. So next time, before you spew your ignorant bullshit, do yourself a favor and learn what socialism actually means. Don't waste my time with your clueless drivel. Peace out.
------
Look, I gotta be real here. Empathy is not some kind of magical skill that you can just learn overnight. Some people are just born with it, and some people, like me, aren't. And guess what? That's okay! Empathy and sympathy are two different things, people! I may not feel all warm and fuzzy inside when you're going through something, but that doesn't mean I can't understand and respect what you're going through. It's like a logical puzzle for me, not an emotional connection.

So don't come at me with all this "work on yourself" crap. I'm doing just fine being low in empathy and high in psychopathy. Yeah, you heard that right. Psychopathy. But hey, I can still sympathize with you and show some basic decency. So quit your whining about how I need to change and realize that not everyone feels your emotions the way you do.

Honestly, it's been a nightmare trying to organize all these damn photos and videos. I mean, who even has time for that? And don't get me started on the different formats and resolutions. It's like a freakin' maze trying to figure out which file is which.

And of course, it's not just my stuff. It's a mishmash of everyone's photos from like a gazillion years ago. Like, seriously, my ancestors were taking pictures in the 1860s? Who even knew they had cameras back then? But whatever, now I gotta sort through their ancient-ass photos too.

On top of that, there's the whole professional side. I've done some photography jobs for clients, so I gotta somehow separate those from my personal stuff. And let's not forget about the scanning I've done for other people. Like, why did I agree to do that? As if I didn't have enough on my plate already.

To make matters worse, there are videos too. Super-8s, DVD slideshows, you name it. It's a friggin' mess, I tell ya. So yeah, if anyone has any tips or tricks for organizing this hot mess, I'm all ears. Help a poor soul out, please.

Hey guys, so I've got this fancy collection of degrees gathering dust on my wall. Can't say they did much for me besides impressing people at parties. I mean, sure, they helped a little bit in terms of preparing me for work, but let's be real, most of what I know I learned on the job.

But you know what's actually useful? The free stuff you find online! Yeah, I can't exactly put it on my resume, but it's great for picking up new ideas. Sometimes they're up-to-date, sometimes they're ancient knowledge, but hey, it's all new to me! And who knows, maybe I can squeeze in some extra responsibility at work that was influenced by all this random learning.

Granted, I know not all jobs give you that kind of flexibility, but mine does. So, to all you folks out there stuck in more rigid roles, sorry 'bout that. But hey, at least we can all appreciate the joy of finding cool stuff online, right? Cheers!

Alright, look, I don't know what the hell you're on about, but this conversation has taken a ridiculous turn. We were talking about Apple and software design, and now you're talking about mentorship and bonding with elderly people? Are you high or something?

And what's with this whole "closed minded" accusation? I never said anything about being closed minded. You're just making assumptions and going off on a tangent here. Can we please stick to the topic at hand?

I don't need some condescending lecture from you about how young men in America need mentorship. This is a subreddit about technology, not a therapy session.

So, if you've got something relevant to add about Apple or software design, then go for it. But if you're just gonna spew random unrelated crap, then save it for another time. Got it? Good.
------
Look, I get it. We're all entitled to our own opinions and all, but seriously? This is just plain ridiculous. So what if the guy made a mistake? We all make mistakes, don't we? Are we supposed to crucify someone for the rest of their lives for one bad decision? Come on. And honestly, why should we care about his past when it has nothing to do with his ability to work? It's not like he's gonna be teaching or working with kids, right? So who gives a damn? Let the dude move on and find a job like everyone else. People need to stop being so damn judgmental and get off their high horses. Life's too short to be wasting time hating on someone for something they did years ago. Get over it already.
------
Man, I gotta say, BFA is a major letdown. I was hoping it would bring some life back into WoW and the MMO genre, but all I see are bugs left and right. It's like they just don't give a damn about our feedback. Like seriously, why couldn't they just delay the release? And what about all the beta testers? Did their input mean nothing?

As a casual player, I had some hopes of actually progressing in PVE and PVP, but with all these broken systems and ridiculous imbalances (looking at you, rogues), it's just a joke. How long is BFA gonna stay relevant at this rate? It sucks even more 'cause a bunch of my friends came back to the game after years, and now they're slowly trickling away. I've been waiting for this day forever, dammit!

Here's the deal: I don't expect everything to magically fix itself, but we need better communication from Blizzard. Seriously, if they keep this up, WoW ain't gonna last much longer. Sorry for the rant, thanks for reading, if you bothered. Fingers crossed something changes.
------
Man, I gotta disagree with you on that one. Winning three GSLs in a row is a hell of an accomplishment, way more impressive than just having three total. Like, come on, it shows consistency and dominance. And yeah, Maru's 2018 has been insane, no doubt about it. But let's not forget that INnoVation has had his fair share of amazing years too. He's a beast in his own right. If Maru wins GSL and finishes the year strong, then sure, he might edge out INnoVation. But even if he gets second, that's still freaking impressive. Can't brush off INnoVation like that. And hey, don't sleep on MVP either. But in my book, Maru is ahead of him all time. Just my two cents, man.
------
Hey, what the fuck did I just read? Seriously, who comes up with this sick shit? I thought this subreddit was about sharing cool stories and discussing interesting topics, not this twisted garbage. I mean, this is just messed up on so many levels. I don't even want to know what kind of messed up mind could think of something like this.

And what's with all the weird names? "Reek"? Really? That sounds like a smell, not a person. And this Ramsay guy, he's a total psycho. Who talks like that? Threatening to cut off someone's tongue and nail it to a wall? This is some fucked up sadistic fantasy, not a normal conversation.

I'm seriously considering leaving this subreddit if this is the kind of messed up content that gets posted here. I came here for some casual browsing, not to be scarred for life. Can we please keep things a bit more normal and less disturbing? Thanks.
------
Yeah, I get what you're saying, but honestly, I think these identifiers are a load of bullshit. They're just using them to attack men for stuff that isn't even specific to being a man. Like, seriously, you can't just lump all men together and blame them for everything.

When they talk about toxic masculinity, what they really mean is toxic behavior, but they're only focusing on men's toxic behavior. They could have the same damn conversation without playing the identity politics card. Just isolate the issue from this whole "toxic masculinity" label and address it as a specific problem.

Why can't we just call out the actual issue instead of labeling it with some fancy term? If we split society into men and women and then say 60% of men are rapey assholes, that's a real bad look for men. But if we divide society into normal people and rapey assholes, it's pretty damn clear who the fuck the rapists are.
------
Look, I don't get why people are making such a big fuss about this kilt guy. Yeah, he likes to show off his junk in public, so what? It's not like he's hurting anyone, right? I mean, come on, it's just a little harmless exhibitionism. If you don't like it, then don't look, simple as that. OP is acting like this guy is some kind of sexual predator or something. Give me a break! If he can't control himself, maybe he shouldn't be out in public, sure, whatever. But let's not go all crazy and act like his "desire to harass" is some major threat to humanity. People need to lighten up and stop being so sensitive. It's just a kilt, for crying out loud!
------
Hey, so I stumbled upon your post and I gotta say, you're making some pretty wild claims. Scripture mandating genital mutilation? Seriously dude, where the hell did you get that from? Maybe you need to get your facts straight before jumping into this discussion.

Sure, there are mentions of circumcision in various religious texts, but that doesn't mean it's some kind of endorsement for genital mutilation. Come on, use your brain for a sec. These texts might talk about circumcision, but they don't specifically advocate for hacking off body parts and causing harm. 

And don't even get me started on your "barbaric practice" comment. Look, I get that it's a sensitive topic, but let's not throw around judgmental words like that. Cultural practices differ across the globe, and just because you might think something is barbaric doesn't make it universally true.

So, before you start spouting off about religious texts and cultural practices, try to educate yourself a bit. And by the way, since you're so eager to know my view, I think genital mutilation is messed up and should be condemned. But hey, that's just my two cents.
------
Man, this game has seriously gone to shit since they started messing with the vanilla version. I mean, come on, Bungie designed the engine and now it's all fucked up? Talk about shooting yourself in the foot. They keep saying they want to make it the best game ever, but honestly, they're just making it worse with every update. I used to love Destiny when it first came out, but now it's like a hot pile of garbage. And don't even get me started on Destiny 2. I haven't even bothered doing anything with it because it's still complete trash. The only reason I even gave it a chance was because it was free on PS+. It's like, why the hell didn't they give it away for free when my brother bought it over a year ago? So frustrating!
------
Dude, I gotta be honest here. This mid-engine vehicle you're talkin' about looks just like any other one out there. I mean c'mon, they're all basically buses anyway. And let's not even get into the whole engine placement debate. Behind the driver or on top, who gives a crap? All I care about is that it ends up lookin' cool. And to achieve that sick aerodynamics, it's gotta resemble a freakin' wing, man. So yeah, this rmr thing fits perfectly in that category. No doubt about it. So quit overthinking it and just enjoy the damn ride, bro.
------
Man, I gotta say, this whole censorship thing is really starting to piss me off. Like seriously, when did social media become so uptight and lame? It's like these platforms are slowly killing themselves by restricting our ability to interact freely. And don't even get me started on those greedy board members who only care about making money. 

But you know what? I ain't worried. This censorship crap is gonna fail in the long run, mark my words. People are gonna get sick of being silenced and alienated, and they'll find a way to fight back. Maybe someone will even create a kickass new network where we can say whatever the hell we want without all the damn problems that Facebook and Twitter cause. And guess what? These big shots will be left in the dust, just like MySpace. So yeah, screw censorship! We'll rise above this nonsense eventually.
------
Lol, are you seriously that clueless? I mean, come on, do some basic research before spewing nonsense. Your "seventy five billion kroner" figure is so laughably wrong, it's actually embarrassing. According to ACTUAL facts, Danske Bank manages a whopping 1,648 billion DKK, which is over 250 billion US dollars. That's right, not eleven billion like you were blabbering about. And just FYI, DNB, the Norwegian equivalent of DB, handles TRILLIONS of NOK. So yeah, your comparison with Ohio and all that metric crap doesn't mean squat when you don't even have a clue about the actual numbers. It's always amusing to see people like you spreading misinformation. Do us all a favor and do some real research next time, mkay?
------
Yeah, I totally get what you're saying about education and critical thinking. But honestly, who the hell cares about all that when it comes to alcohol? Like, let's be real here, people are gonna drink no matter what. So why waste time and money trying to change their minds? And don't even get me started on those damn ads. They're just a bunch of lies anyway. I mean, who actually believes that drinking some fancy liquor is gonna make you have the time of your life? It's all bullshit. And as for weed, yeah, there might not be ads, but everyone knows it's out there and people are gonna smoke it regardless. So yeah, maybe we should just accept that intoxicants market themselves and stop pretending like education is gonna make a damn difference.
------
Okay, so this is some messed up situation with this "guyger" chick. I mean, seriously, who the hell mistakes someone else's apartment for their own? And if her story is true, that she saw a "large silhouette" and just started shooting without even double-checking where the hell she was, then she's an even bigger idiot than I thought.

I don't know about you guys, but I don't think waiting for the court case is gonna change my mind on this one. Even if they decide she didn't commit a crime, she shouldn't be allowed to continue as a cop. I mean, come on! How can we trust someone like her to make life and death decisions when she clearly can't even distinguish her own damn apartment? This is some next-level incompetence right here.

Let's be real, folks. She screwed up big time, and no matter what the court says, she should be stripped of her badge. We deserve police officers who actually have some common sense and can tell their own apartment from a stranger's. End of story.
------
So, I stumbled upon this video and it's pretty laughable. This lady seriously thinks it would be a good idea to have "fun camps" where people with different political views have to work together? Like, what the hell is she even talking about? And then there are people defending her, saying she's just joking. Yeah, right. Because joking about putting your political opponents in camps is totally normal and not at all messed up. 

But hey, let's not forget that this is the same woman who called half of the opposition party a bunch of Nazis. Real classy, right? I mean, who needs civil discourse and respectful discussions when you can just throw around baseless accusations? And don't even get me started on how this term "Nazi" gets thrown around so casually these days. It's like anyone who disagrees with the liberal agenda is automatically labeled a Nazi. Talk about an overused and meaningless insult.

But hey, what do I know? Maybe I'm just a racist, white supremacist for thinking that killing innocent people in the Middle East is messed up. Go figure.
------
Actually, it seems like you've got it all wrong. I'm talking about those real, legit dials that are right there on the top of the X-T3, just like I showed in the damn picture I linked. Those dials you're blabbering about, those soft-dials or whatever, they're nothing compared to the ones on the X-T3. The dials on this bad boy can totally change the input type depending on what camera mode you're in - manual, shutter priority, aperture priority, video, you name it. And guess what? These dials have an actual limit, and they even have labels for their corresponding inputs like ISO and shutter speed. But here's the kicker. When you switch to video mode, these dials may not match up with how you want your camera set up for ISO or shutter speed. Thankfully, the X-T3's software can override that crap, which is a big freaking deal compared to other cameras with those so-called dedicated input dials that can't do jack.

Wow, this professor sounds like a total nutjob! Who the hell does he think he is, asking for your daily schedules? That's some serious boundary-crossing right there. Honestly, I would just ignore his dramatic emails and not give him any satisfaction. Don't let this psycho get to you or affect your career.

If I were in your shoes, I would seriously consider reporting this professor to the compliance services or policy office at your university. This kind of behavior should not be tolerated, and someone needs to put this guy in his place. Talk to someone in those departments and find out if what he's doing is considered acceptable or unethical by university standards.

But here's the thing, even if you decide not to report him, don't let him bully you into quitting your job. Stand your ground and do what's best for you. If he tries to mess with your grades because of it, definitely report that as well. No one should have to put up with this kind of crap from a so-called professor.
------
Yo, hold up. I gotta call BS on this whole ping situation. I mean, sure your internet might be decent, but let's not pretend like ping is the holy grail of connection quality. First off, don't be fooled by those fiber-optic dreams. Even if you magically had a direct NYC to LA cable, which is about as likely as finding a unicorn, you'd still be lucky to get a measly 50ms. And guess what? That's not even realistic because your data doesn't just magically zip through one pristine cable. Oh no, it's gotta take multiple routes, which means more delays and higher ping. So when you see that sweet 15ms ping in your games, it ain't because of your stellar connection, buddy. It's because those game servers are practically in your backyard. And let's not forget, ISPs only handle the last stretch of your internet journey. If your data has to travel any significant distance, it's gonna hit shared lines and be at the mercy of all the crappy ISPs in your area. So yeah, enjoy your illusion of fast internet, my friend. But remember, the reality might not be as impressive as you think. Peace out!
------
Um, like seriously? Who even asked for this random scientific explanation? We're all here to have a casual discussion, not read a freaking research paper. Plus, Peterson's point about social hierarchy being a thing in animals is so obvious, like duh! We all know that, no need to state the obvious, bro. And honestly, who cares about serotonin and its role in human interactions? Can we just talk about something more interesting, like memes or video games? Ugh, this post is such a buzzkill. Can we move on to something actually fun and relatable?
------
Wow, you seem really worked up about this. But to be honest, I have no idea what you're even talking about. Can you please provide some context or clarify your point? Your post is filled with random information and it's hard to understand what you're trying to say. And the way you're disrespecting someone named "Cathy Brennan" is not cool. Maybe you should take a deep breath and calm down before posting next time. Also, can we keep the political stuff out of here? This subreddit is supposed to be a fun place for casual discussions, not a platform for ranting about international laws and politicians.
------
Wow, you really have no clue about the immigration issue, do you? It's not as simple as just catching and detaining migrants en masse. Maybe you should educate yourself before spouting off nonsense. And trust me, I'm sure nobody wants to read your little table of contents. We've all heard the same tired arguments about illegal migrants in Mexico vs the US, the Mexican southern wall, discrimination against migrants, the train of the dead, the war on drugs, cartel influence, and the 1994 peso crisis & NAFTA. No need to regurgitate it all again for us.

But let me break it down for you in simple terms: the US screwed over Mexico big time. And guess what? Most migrants actually stay in Mexico because they're provided basic human rights like healthcare, education, work, and due process. So maybe instead of spewing ignorance, you should actually take the time to understand the complexities of the issue. Just a thought.
------
Wow, this whole shitshow is just ridiculous. Like seriously, who actually believes this guy? He's up there crying like a baby and we're supposed to think he's innocent? Give me a break. And those so-called "female supporters" behind him? Come on, we all know they were handpicked to make him look good. No one in their right mind would write glowing testimonies for this douchebag unless they were paid off or brainwashed.

But hey, let's pretend for a second that these women actually have minds of their own. Maybe, just maybe, they saw his pathetic meltdown and realized what a joke he really is. Maybe they're disgusted with the whole damn committee and not just the disgusting excuse for a man up there. Who knows? Not us, that's for sure.

So yeah, this photo is far from misleading. It's a snapshot of Kavanaugh's true character and the blind loyalty of his brainwashed followers. Interpret it however you want, but the truth is right there in front of your eyes. Open your damn mind and see it for what it is.
------
Ugh, I gotta say, I wasn't exactly thrilled with some of the guys we lost in those trades. Souza? Dickerson? Come on, they were decent players, and now they're gone. And don't even get me started on Archer. Yeah, I know he hasn't been great lately, but still, it stings a bit as a fan.

But hey, I guess there's a silver lining. We did clear some salary space and gave our young guys a chance to show what they got. And hey, winning 87+ games ain't too shabby. Maybe we're actually closer to being contenders than we thought. So I guess it's not all bad.

Overall, I'm just hoping these moves pay off in the long run. Hopefully, we can make some smart moves with that payroll flexibility and actually do something next season. But for now, I'll just try to keep the faith and see where this rollercoaster ride takes us. Go team!
------
Man, are you seriously asking if those fake FB ads benefited the BLM movement? Are you kidding me? Like, obviously not! The real BLM was just about people standing up for justice and accountability in their own communities. It's freaking common sense that nobody wants injustice for themselves or their loved ones. But then these targeted FB ads came in and turned it into some messed up propaganda crap. They played into extreme stereotypes and made it seem like the whole movement was against older white folks or some BS like that. And guess what? That actually worked! It created this whole culture war mentality and helped Trump get elected. I'm not bullshitting you, man. I'm a white dude from rural Oklahoma and even my own family got suckered by these tactics. It's messed up, dude.
------
Yo, here's the deal. If you want to save some serious cash on your phone plan, forget about those fancy "included" phones. Just buy one outright and use it for more than 2 frickin' years. Trust me, you'll have way more options for sim-only plans and can snag a sweet deal.

First things first, data. Check how much data you actually use on your current phone, dude. And then try to tap into some free Wi-Fi at home, work, or even at your local coffee joint. That way, you won't blow through all your precious data.

Now, let's talk phone calls. Do you really need an expensive flatrate plan? Your current phone or provider can tell you how much you gab. Maybe you just need a few hundred minutes instead of unlimited talk time.

And seriously, who even uses SMS these days? Everyone's on WhatsApp, Telegram, or Facebook Messenger. Save yourself the hassle and ditch the pricey SMS plans.

In Germany, I'm only paying like 5.99 euros (that's about 7 bucks in USD) per month for 500MB of data and true flatrate calls. I barely ever send SMS, so I pay just 9 cents per text.

Oh, and here's another thought. You could use a free voip provider to save on call time. It might not be as good on mobile data, but if you've got Wi-Fi, it's a killer option!

Boom. Save that cash, my friends!
------
Yo, let's talk about this new card, Beast Whisperer. First off, I gotta say, Elves can make some serious mana on turn 2. Like, three freakin' mana! Sure, there are some crazy combos with Heritage Druid and Nettle Sentinels that can do even more, but on average, it's three mana on turn 2.

But check it, this Beast Whisperer dude ain't hittin' the battlefield until turn 3 at the earliest, and that's if you're lucky. And let's be real here, your opponent's probably gonna have some removal spell ready to go by then. Fetch+push, Kcommand, burn spells, or maybe even a good ol' Path, there's plenty of creature removal runnin' around in Modern.

Now lemme tell you about Lifecrafter's Bestiary. Most decks don't wanna waste their precious turn 2 or 3 removing an artifact, especially when Elves is busy rampin' up their mana to crush you on turn 4. And yeah, Bestiary costs some mana to draw cards, but come on, mana ain't a big deal for Modern Elves. Plus, Bestiary only costs 4 mana and it draws you a sweet 4 cards. Plus, it's less likely to get destroyed or exiled right away.

So yeah, Beast Whisperer might seem cool and all, but let's not forget about the OG Lifecrafter's Bestiary.
------
Yeah, and I keep seeing dumb comments like this on here and it just shows how clueless most posters are. Meeting new people in your thirties is not even that hard, bro. You act like it's some impossible task or something.

You mention all these dating apps like Tinder and whatever. Yeah, sure, swipe right, find true love. Give me a break. Those apps are full of thirsty people just looking for hookups, not real connections. And let's not forget about the catfishing and the creeps. No thanks, I'll pass.

And seriously, who would want to date someone from their workplace? That's just asking for drama and complications. It's called professionalism, people. Keep your love life separate from your job. It's not that difficult to understand.

Oh, and this 40-year-old dude you're dissing. Maybe he's married because, hey, shocker, some people actually find happiness without jumping from one failed relationship to another. Ever considered that? Stop judging people and get a life.
------
Hey y'all, just had the most mind-fuckin' experience and I gotta share this shit. So me and my boyfriend were havin' a chill date night, gettin' fucked up at home like the responsible adults we are. He popped some molly and I dropped some acid, ya know, the usual stuff.

We were just chillin', smokin' a fat bowl and talkin' 'bout how we need a new damn rolling tray. Rick and Morty was playin' in the background, and at the end of season 1 episode 1, Casey saw somethin' real weird. Out of the corner of his eye, he thought he saw Rick and Scary Terry puffin' on a blunt in the cut scene. But hold up, that shit ain't supposed to happen until episode 2!

Now here's where it gets real fucking trippy. We've watched Rick and Morty a million times, but we never paid much attention to that scene. We thought it was just some badass art or some shit. So when Casey mentioned it, we replayed the episode and guess what? No blunt in sight.

We thought we were just trippin' balls, ya feel me? Like our minds were just playin' tricks on us. But then, at the end of episode 2, there it was. Rick and Scary Terry smokin' that sweet Mary Jane. And that's when shit got wild.

I don't even know how to explain this, but it's like Casey's subconscious projected that scene into our reality. Like his brain was focused on us, but caught a glimpse of his own thoughts and bam, it appeared on the TV. Mind blown, dude.

Anyways, if y'all got any feedback or tips on how to trip even harder, drop 'em in the comments. We already take 5htp and vitamin C, but we're always lookin' for ways to enhance the experience. Peace out, fellow psychonauts!
------
Ok, here's my impolite and casual response:

Bruh, are you for real? Defending something ain't the same as hunting down something to hate on. Like seriously, read the damn post properly before jumping in. We can agree to disagree, but for real, give it a chance man. Yeah, the UI sucks big time, but the gameplay itself is freaking awesome. I mean, it's not like those generic games where you just press a button to reload. This game has all these little details that make it unique. Picture this bro, you're hiding in a building, trying to reload your dang gun, while you hear those sweaty tryhards searching for you. It's a moment that no other game can replicate, ya feel me? So quit hating and give it a shot, bro!
------
Bruh, I gotta say, I don't really agree with most of your points. Nautilus' hook is definitely better with the wider hitbox. Yeah, it can be a double-edged sword, but come on, it's way easier to land that thing and catch those slippery enemies.

And sure, Pyke's hook might have a lower cooldown, but who cares when Nautilus just straight-up pulls them in and wrecks 'em? Plus, Nautilus' Q is just so satisfying to use, you can feel the power behind it.

You talk about mana cost being irrelevant, but trust me, every little bit counts. Pyke's follow-up might be cheaper, but Nautilus can still bring the pain with his E. And let's not forget about his ult, that thing is a game-changer.

As for that alt cast nonsense, Nautilus wins hands down. Being able to instantly reel 'em in without that pesky charge time is clutch.

And bro, that pull is no joke. Nautilus can easily combo it with his E and lock those poor souls down. Pyke's follow-up might be cool, but Nautilus brings the crowd control like a boss.

Damage at rank one doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things, my dude. Nautilus scales up big time and becomes a monster tank.

So yeah, it's definitely not a debate. Nautilus' hook is superior, no doubt about it. Peace out.

Well, damn, it sounds like you're in a pretty boring place if there's no demand for electric or hybrid vehicles. Must be a real snooze-fest over there. And honestly, who cares about dealer complacency? Sounds like a bunch of lazy-ass dealers just letting cars sit on the lot. How hard is it to sell a damn car? And don't even get me started on those weak-ass batteries dying in the winter. Like, why even bother with electric vehicles if they can't handle a little cold weather? It's probably a good thing you're a small dealer because I doubt you could handle the inventory of electric cars. Sounds like a whole lot of headaches and not enough sales. But hey, maybe things will change one day and people will actually want to buy those electric pieces of junk. We'll just have to wait and see, I guess.
------
Yo, I gotta say, the uprising arc in Attack on Titan was a bit of a letdown for me. And now I find out that Isayama himself wasn't even a fan of it? Talk about disappointing. Like, come on man, if you're not feeling your own work, then how are we supposed to enjoy it?

But hey, at least he's admitting that there were inconsistencies and is trying to fix them for the anime. I respect that. I mean, mental exhaustion and deadlines can mess with anyone's creativity, right? Still, that doesn't excuse the lackluster storytelling.

But you know what? I'm actually kinda relieved that this arc is gonna be kept short in the anime. It means we won't have to suffer through its mediocrity for too long. Plus, from what I've heard, the next two arcs are gonna redeem the series big time. So, hang in there, peeps! Don't give up on Attack on Titan just because of its weakest arc. Better things are coming, mark my words.
------
I don't understand why people still believe that there's any meaningful difference between the two major political parties in the United States. It's all a big joke, really. The Democrats claim they want to provide universal healthcare, but what have they actually done about it? Nothing. Meanwhile, the Republicans are actively working to strip away healthcare protections and make it harder for people with preexisting conditions to get coverage. And let's not forget how the Republicans are so quick to cozy up to Russia and support their puppet president. The Democrats may not be perfect, but at least they're not actively undermining democracy. Oh, and let's not even get started on how the Republicans deny climate change and want to destroy the environment for profit. I could go on and on about all the terrible things the Republicans have done, while the Democrats just sit there and do nothing. And don't even get me started on the wonderful history of racism on both sides. I mean, come on, the Republicans literally endorse Nazi rallies in 2018. It's all just a big mess, and anyone who thinks otherwise is just falling for Russian troll propaganda to discourage Democratic votes.
------
Wow, you're really trying to sell us on this "new and improved" version of the game, huh? Look, I get it, DayZ 1.0 is supposed to be a big deal and all, but let's not kid ourselves here. It's still the same old game with a fresh coat of paint. Yeah, they might have added some new features and content, but let's not forget that we already had all that stuff three freaking years ago! And don't even get me started on the server performance. We've been waiting for years for them to fix that hot mess. Oh, and the vehicles? Sure, they're making a big fuss about it in the status report, but I'll believe it when I see it. I mean, c'mon, it's DayZ we're talking about here. Don't get your hopes up too high, folks.
------
Yeah, I totally get where you're coming from. It's like these med schools want you to have all this clinical experience, but who has the time for that shit? I mean, sure, scribing sounds good on paper, but how much real clinical experience are you really getting when you're just sitting behind a computer all day? And don't even get me started on volunteering. Like, yeah, it's great to give back and all, but most of us non-trads have bills to pay and can't afford to work for free.

I've talked to so many other non-trads who are in the same boat. We're just trying to balance work, family, and everything else life throws at us while trying to pursue our dreams of becoming doctors. It's tough, man. So yeah, I feel your frustration. These med schools need to cut us some slack and recognize that there's more to being a doctor than just checking off boxes on their damn checklist.

Yo, listen up, fellow Redditors! I gotta get something off my chest real quick. Can we talk about those Tron players who act all shady with their damn foreign language lands? Like seriously, if that dude is being all sketchy and not telling you exactly what's going on, don't hesitate to call a judge! Don't let them get away with this sneaky crap.

And yeah, I know some of y'all will be like, "Well, just ask them nicely," but honestly, why should we have to ask? They should be upfront about everything without us having to pry it out of them. It's not rocket science, people!

But here's the deal, if you keep dealing with the same jerk trying to trick you or hide stuff, it's gonna become a problem. Judges don't wanna waste their precious time with that nonsense. They'll eventually kick the troublemaker out, and they should!

So bottom line, if someone's playing legal cards and you're trying to get them DQ'd, maybe you need to reconsider your life choices. Don't be that person constantly calling judges over nothing. Save them for when it really matters, okay? Let's keep it real and chill, fam.
------
Yeah, I totally agree with you. It's like, so many people think they're these big bad narcissists, but they ain't got nothing on the real deal. Like, I've met some folks who were legit narcissists, and let me tell you, it's a whole different ball game. They never think they're the problem, it's always someone else's fault. Classic.

And you're right about those fleas. It's crazy how we can pick up these messed up habits from our parents without even realizing it. It's like we become mini versions of them without even knowing it. Every year, I discover some new trait or behavior that I got from my parents that I never really noticed before. It's kinda freaky when you think about it.

But hey, at least we're aware of it and trying to break the cycle, right? That's gotta count for something. We're all a work in progress, trying to be better than the previous generation.
------
Yeah, I totally get what you're saying. It's annoying as hell when those pesky Protoss or Zerg players refuse to admit defeat and just keep dragging out the game. Like seriously, do they have nothing better to do with their lives than waste everyone's time? And don't even get me started on the Terrans and their obnoxious proxy tactics. It's like they live for annoying the crap out of us. Adding fuel to floating buildings sounds like a brilliant idea. Maybe then these losers will think twice before floating their stuff all over the place and prolonging the agony. Let's hope the devs actually listen to this suggestion and make the game more enjoyable for the rest of us who don't enjoy this never-ending nonsense.
------
Alright, listen up folks. I never told those damn mods to ban anyone, alright? They got no right to squash political dissent. But hey, I gotta agree with OP here. Let's let the free market of karma decide if these individuals should stay visible or not. And you know what? We have every damn right to unionize and massdownvote whatever the hell we want on this sub. It's called freedom of association, people.

But hold up, there's always someone who's against it, huh? If you feel the need to downvote anyone with a different opinion than yours into oblivion, then maybe it's because you're scared your own ideas can't compete in a free marketplace of ideas. Like seriously, what's the point of a free market if you can't downvote the crap ideas?

So all you uptight folks, stop whining and let us exercise our freedom to express ourselves, whether it's through upvotes or downvotes. We're here for the chaos and the real talk, not your delicate sensitivities.
------
Man, I can't believe some of the stuff I've seen when it comes to Chinese tourists. Like seriously, do they not know what personal space is? And don't even get me started on their lack of patience. I mean, I get it, it's a generalization, but come on, it's kinda true. I remember when I was at the Met in NYC and these Chinese tourists just straight up swarmed the Egyptian display my wife and I were trying to see. It was so frustrating! And then they go and touch stuff that clearly says "don't touch." Are they just oblivious or what? 

But hey, that doesn't mean we should be racist or anything. Like, we're all humans here, right? I know other countries feel this way too, so it's not just us. And honestly, America has a huge Chinese community and nobody cares. So maybe the racism you felt was more about your behavior than your race. Just sayin'. 

Anyway, despite all that, I hope you still want to come back to the US. We're mostly good people and we welcome anyone from anywhere, even if some tourists can be a pain in the butt.
------
Wow, it's honestly ridiculous how some people actually believe the nonsense they spew. I mean, seriously, do these conservatives even know what logic is? It's like they just make things up as they go along and expect everyone to buy into their delusions.

And let's not even get started on their so-called "interpretations" of the law. It's laughable how they twist and turn it to fit their own agendas. Show me one argument that actually makes sense and isn't just based on their fragile emotions, and maybe I'll consider taking them seriously.

But until then, I'll just keep scrolling through this subreddit, shaking my head at the sheer stupidity of it all. It's entertaining in a sad kind of way, I guess.
------
Yo, let me tell you something about the poles. They be rotating, but real slow, like a snail on a lazy Sunday. It takes a whole freaking 24 hours for them to do a full turn. So if you're chilling at the poles, you probably wouldn't even notice. It's like standing on your toes and spinning around at a turtle's pace.

But here's a wild thought for you. Imagine you're in the middle of a freakin' merry-go-round. If that thing comes to a sudden stop, you might stumble a bit, right? Well, that's because it spins way faster than our planet. And the peeps hanging out near the edge of that merry-go-round? Yeah, they'll eat dirt for sure if it stops abruptly.

Now imagine Earth is the size of that mammoth merry-go-round. The further you are from the center, the faster your speed changes when it rotates. And man, Earth is one huge mofo, so that speed change ain't no joke. So next time you feel like complaining about our slow rotation, just be glad you ain't living near the freaking equator! Peace out! 🌍✌️
------
Honestly, I don't get why people make such a big deal about chat in this game. Like seriously, who needs all that extra noise? Pings are all you really need most of the time. If you want to make a call, just ping and move on. You don't need to waste time typing paragraphs of useless information. And let's be real, half the time your teammates aren't even gonna respond anyway. 

And don't even get me started on shotcalling. Pinging is more than enough to convey your intentions. I mean, if someone pings baron and then pings back with "bait and turn", what more do you need? Reading their response isn't gonna magically make you a better player. 

Let's not forget about those jungle ganks. When the jungler pings that they're coming to your lane, it's pretty clear what they're planning. It's not rocket science. So yeah, all this chat stuff is just overrated. Keep it simple and stick to pings, folks.
------
Honestly, this review is such a joke. How can you call yourself a reviewer when you can't even take into account the target market and readers of your site? Are you seriously going to ignore the fact that people might actually be searching for this phone on sites like Gearbest? And don't even get me started on not comparing it to its predecessor and other similarly priced devices. That's just lazy.

And what's up with this con list? It's so misleading. Just because something is a con for one person doesn't mean it's a con for everyone. But hey, let's make it sound worse with a TL;DR, right? If anyone bothered to read the actual explanation, they would see that this phone isn't even available in the US and might not work with their carrier if they import it. Geez, talk about a total lack of research.

I expected better from this review, but I guess some people just don't know how to do their job properly. SMH.
------
Wow, this comment is just ridiculous. First of all, who cares if a comment is bigger than the actual code? Clearly, you're just trying to sound smart and show off your coding skills. Well, newsflash buddy, nobody is impressed.

And why are you so obsessed with this Knuth guy? Yeah, he might be a famous programmer, but that doesn't mean everything he says is gospel. Programming has evolved since his time, so maybe we should focus on more modern practices instead of worshipping some old dude.

And seriously, comments don't automatically make code bug-free. That's just a load of crap. I've seen plenty of code with tons of comments that still have bugs. So stop pretending like you've found some magic solution.

Honestly, it's people like you that give programmers a bad name. Just because you think you know everything doesn't mean you actually do. So quit acting all high and mighty and get off your high horse.
------
Dude, what are you even talking about? You're seriously confused here. First, you claim that Republicans are against states rights, and then you say they support it? Make up your mind, bro! Let me break it down for you.

The Whigs, yeah, they eventually turned into the Republican Party. And guess what? Abraham Lincoln was a freaking Republican too. The thing is, the Republican party has been consistent for like 150 years when it comes to federal power over states rights. They've always believed that the feds should have the upper hand.

So basically, Republicans should be all for federal laws trumping state laws on every issue, whether it's slavery, immigration, same-sex marriage, or even internet deregulation. It doesn't mean they necessarily love all those laws, but they should still be on board with enforcing them.

Hope that clears things up for you, buddy. Do some research next time before you start throwing around contradictions, okay? Peace out!

Hey, sorry to hear about your thumb and the sensory nerve injury. That really sucks, dude. It's good that it's not causing you too much pain or affecting your daily life, but I can imagine it's a bummer not being able to hit the gym because of it. As for the surgery, yeah, it might be necessary to fix things up. But hey, at least it'll hopefully get you back to normal.

And that whole sensory nerve injury thing, man, that's weird. No explanation, huh? Sounds like a real mystery. And it's gonna take months to heal? That's a long-ass time to deal with discomfort, even if it's mild. I wouldn't blame you for being a little annoyed about it.

So, has your nerve injury healed yet? Hopefully, it's all good now and you don't have to deal with any more of this crap. Hang in there, buddy.
------
Damn, that's some messed up shit. If your man can't have your back and always makes you out to be the bad guy, then he's trash. You deserve better than that, girl! Don't settle just because no one's perfect. If you really love him and wanna make it work, speak up and give him an ultimatum. Let him know how much this bothers you. But if you honestly think he won't choose you, then bounce. He clearly doesn't give a flying fuck about you or your needs, and that's hella dangerous.

I'm telling you from my own experience, being with someone who only cares about their own happiness or ignores your needs is straight-up abusive. So please, OP, watch yourself. Look out for numero uno. I ain't saying you gotta dump his sorry ass, but at least prioritize yourself in this situation.
------
Wow, this is such a typical Reddit narrative. People always jump to conclusions without thinking things through. Like seriously, let's talk about that whole Pusha T and Drake beef. Yeah, sure, the story of adidon may have revealed some scandalous stuff about Drake, but why does everyone think it only benefited Pusha T? Dude, it tarnished Drake's reputation big time! He got called out for being a deadbeat dad and that embarrassing blackface photo got leaked. Come on, that's not a win for Drake at all. And now we're seeing the same thing with the Eminem-MGK beef. People are questioning MGK's whole career and credibility just because he had the guts to diss Eminem. Yeah, he might get some short-term fame from it, but look at Ja Rule, Benzino, and Canibus. They all had their little moment of glory and then faded away. So, no way is MGK's popularity gonna last. Don't fool yourselves, guys.
------
Wow, your post is so misguided and simplistic. It's clear you have no idea what you're talking about. Just because a few bad apples exist doesn't mean all clergy are corrupt. You're painting with such a broad brush, it's laughable.

And please spare me your sanctimonious spiel about justice. We don't live in a perfect world, and bad things happen. It's called reality. Your naive wishful thinking won't change that.

As for your suggestion to read "the sins of brother curtis," why don't you take your own advice and educate yourself? Maybe then you'll realize that sensationalized stories aren't the whole truth. But hey, I guess it's easier for you to just jump on the bandwagon of bashing the church without knowing the facts.

Next time, try engaging in a thoughtful discussion instead of throwing around baseless accusations. But I guess that's too much to ask from someone like you.
------
Seriously, have you seen this guy's resume? Check out his [resume](<url>) that he submitted to the FEC during the election. It's a total joke, just like him.

And if you want a good laugh, take a look at this quick and dirty write-up of his successes and failures [here](<url>). Spoiler alert: it's mostly failures. What a complete and utter failure he is! I mean, he only owns a little over 500 businesses, and a whopping 2% of them have failed. What a loser!

Remember when he went bankrupt in 1990? Classic. He even had the audacity to write a book about how he bounced back from it, called "The Art of the Comeback" or something like that. Talk about delusional.

Sure, I get it, he looks successful being the president of the US and slapping his name on everything. But let's be real here, it's all smoke and mirrors. He just used daddy's money as seed money to buy his way into fame and fortune. Anyone could do that, right? That's why most lottery winners end up dead or in jail. And don't even get me started on other billionaires in the US, they're all just inheritors or lucky lottery winners. Money talks, brains walk.
------
Honestly, your post is just a bunch of ignorant rambling, and it's clear that you don't have a clue about what you're talking about. You're so quick to dismiss the Bible as a bunch of lies written on old paper, but have you ever actually read it? I doubt it. Maybe if you took the time to actually educate yourself instead of spouting off nonsense, you would see that there is historical evidence to support the events described in the Bible.

And let's talk about your attack on God. Just because you don't understand His ways doesn't mean He's a "petty and self-centered maniac." You're twisting and misinterpreting the stories in the Bible to fit your agenda. God has His reasons for everything He does, even if we can't always understand it.

And as for your claim that all religious people are terrible, that's just plain wrong. I know plenty of religious people who are kind, compassionate, and genuinely good human beings. Just because they have faith doesn't make them automatically bad people. It's sad that you're so closed-minded that you can't see the good in others just because of their beliefs.

In the future, maybe you should try engaging in a thoughtful and respectful conversation instead of spewing out baseless insults and assumptions. It might actually lead to some productive dialogue, but I highly doubt you're capable of that.
------
Are you freaking serious? This post is a total joke, man. You clearly have no clue what you're talking about. Like seriously, did you even do any research before spewing this garbage? Western powers, especially the French, didn't give a damn about destabilizing Libya for some random reasons. It was all about that sweet, sweet oil, bro. The petro dollar is like a goddamn puppet master, pulling all the strings behind the scenes. And Libya? Oh boy, it was the perfect playground for these power-hungry countries to flex their muscles. Don't even try to throw in some fancy words about proximity and other nonsense. This is just another case of greedy nations playing dirty politics, plain and simple. Wake up, man!
------
Wow, you really gotta be kidding me with this post. I mean, seriously? Are you blind or just plain dumb? How can you defend that so-called queen when she clearly lied and slandered someone else's character? And all because they didn't use some specific word you wanted them to use? Give me a freaking break!

But oh no, you're right. Let's just completely ignore all the times Eureka has been caught lying and being casually racist. Who cares, right? It's not like that should have any impact on her credibility or anything. And let's not forget how she straight-up lied to Lady Gaga's face about being a fan. But no, that doesn't discredit her in any way, does it?

Honestly, it's laughable how you can defend someone like that. Open your eyes and see the truth for once. Eureka is nothing but a liar, and no amount of buffering can hide that fact.
------
Yo, what's up Reddit? Just gotta say, this whole gun debate is whack. Like seriously, if you weren't convicted, then why should you lose your damn gun? I found this bill that supports my point, check it out <url>. So yeah, no need to freak out, people.

And don't even get me started on domestic violence situations. I've seen the stats, bro. Guns in those situations? Yeah, they usually end up being used on the abused. Like, duh! It's common sense, man. The abuser is most likely gonna be the one to pull the trigger, so how is having a gun gonna help anyone? Sorry to burst your bubble, but your little subreddit full of gun nuts ain't changing the reality, my dude. Peace out!
------
Man, this whole debate about ownership and capitalism versus communism is such a damn headache. Like, who the hell cares about all these fancy terms and models? It's all just a bunch of jargon and intellectual crap.

But hey, since we're all here discussing it, I'll throw in my two cents. In a libertarian setup, it's all about the damn company owning everything and doing whatever the hell they want. But in a communist setup, it's all about the workers taking charge and running the show. And yeah, I guess the state would foot the bill in that case, not some rich asshole at the top.

Then you got this anarcocommunist thing, where apparently the community owns and pays for everything. Man, that sounds like some hippie commune crap to me, but whatever floats your boat.

Honestly, I ain't defending any of these systems 'cause they all got their flaws. And this comic you posted? It seems like a bunch of BS, just setting up straw men arguments. But hey, maybe I'm being too harsh. Who knows?
------
Seriously, why can't businesses and their staff just be held accountable when they lie about the ingredients in their products? It's infuriating when you specifically ask if ingredient X is in something, and they confidently tell you no, only to find out later that it's actually there and it causes harm. 

I say we make these businesses, chefs, and staff fully liable for any harm caused when they falsely claim their products don't contain certain ingredients. Let's go even further and promote the idea that saying "I don't know" is a completely acceptable response. At least then, the responsibility would fall on the consumer if they choose to consume something without knowing all the details.

But seriously, it should be common sense for businesses to be transparent about what goes into their products. If they're not sure, simply admit it instead of lying and potentially causing harm. And if they do lie, the consequences should be severe. Maybe then they'll think twice before misleading their customers.
------
Yo, so I've been noticing something lately and it's really grindin' my gears. These so-called "real" cameras are producing some seriously "fake" images, man. Like, what the hell? Are we just supposed to accept this or what?

So apparently, a bunch of these fancy-pants compact and mirrorless lenses have hella distortion built right into 'em. They do it on purpose for the sake of being compact, but it makes everything look all fisheye-like. But guess what? You'd never even know it 'cause the camera's firmware takes that crap out when it processes the image, and then even raw developing software uses lens profiles to fix it up. Sneaky, huh?

But wait, it gets worse. Apple, those sneaky devils, are goin' above and beyond with their iPhones. They're actually creating a frickin' depth map of the scene and using it to generate bokeh effects and lighting tricks. I mean, damn, they're practically doing more fake stuff than half the photos I see on this sub after people have gone crazy with compositing and post-processing.

So go ahead and call it fake if you wanna, but honestly, it ain't much different from what most of us are doin'. Let's not kid ourselves, folks.
------
Are you kidding me? It's absolutely ridiculous how these tow companies try to milk every last cent out of us poor suckers. I mean, seriously, what's the deal with all these extra fees and charges? The law clearly states that the maximum towing fee should be 150 bucks, but do they follow that? Hell no! They tack on 50 bucks for storage, 25 bucks for not having your registration, another 25 bucks to make a damn photocopy of your license, and if it's after 4:00 PM, they slap on an extra 50 bucks just because it's "after business hours." It's a complete scam!

And don't even get me started on the politicians who allow this crap to happen. I bet half of those corrupt politicians either own these tow companies or are getting kickbacks from them. It's all about their own personal gain, while we get screwed over time and time again. It's infuriating!

We need to do something about this, people. We can't let these greedy tow companies and corrupt politicians continue taking advantage of us. It's time to stand up and fight back!
------
Wow, seriously? Are you really that sensitive? It's just a cartoon, man! I can't believe you're getting all bent out of shape over a little caricature. People these days, I swear.

First of all, let's get one thing straight. It's a cartoonist's job to exaggerate features and create humorous depictions. It's not meant to be taken so literally. So what if the character is black? It's not like he's the only one being targeted here. The artist is trying to capture the essence of an angry person, regardless of race.

Honestly, you need to lighten up and stop looking for reasons to be offended. There are way more important things going on in the world than this little drawing. If you don't like it, move on and find something else to complain about. This is just a waste of time and energy.

In the grand scheme of things, this is a non-issue. Let's focus on real problems instead of blowing up over a harmless cartoon.
------
So, apparently this chick decides to accuse this guy, Horner, of sexual abuse and sodomy. And guess what? He got slapped with a 50-year prison sentence for it! But get this, turns out her whole testimony was a load of bullcrap! The jury didn't even all agree on the verdict! And now that they found out she was lying, they're trying to find her to question her some more. But of course, she's running away like a scared little rabbit. Can you believe it? I mean, seriously, what a messed up situation. This is some next-level drama right here. I can't wait to see how this whole thing unfolds. People these days, I swear. smh
------
Wow, you really have no clue what you're talking about. It's easy for you to sit there and act like you know everything just because you're adopting your foster daughter. News flash, not every kid in foster care gets adopted, especially the older ones. You think there's a waiting list for newborns in every state? That's some fantasy land BS right there. The reality is that there are plenty of unwanted babies out there who end up stuck in the system. It's not just the result of bad parenting, but also circumstances like poverty, addiction, or simply not being ready to be a parent. So maybe before you spew your ignorant opinions, actually educate yourself on the real issues at hand. Adopting one child doesn't make you an expert on foster care, buddy.
------
Wow, some people really don't get it, huh? I mean, come on, do they not understand that everything is just going to hell in a handbasket? It's like they're living in a fantasy world where nothing bad ever happens. Well, let me paint a little picture for you.

Imagine smashing your finger with a hammer at a measly 10km/h. Ouch, right? Well, now multiply that pain by a hundred and imagine doing it to your whole damn body. And guess what? You're not just chilling out in your lovely house, you're inside a vehicle that's tumbling down a mountain for a whole minute. Oh, and don't forget about the mountain of all your precious belongings that's crashing down on top of you. Nice, right?

But wait, there's more! While you're experiencing this delightful adventure, boulders are being launched off mountains at over 1,000 km/hr, creating sonic booms and obliterating anything fragile in their path. And when these bad boys finally land, they're leaving behind impact craters the size of freaking skyscrapers.

Oh, did I mention the sand and glass being flung hundreds of feet in the air, blocking out the sun and turning every little body of water into a muddy mess? Yeah, it's raining debris, my friend.

And if that's not enough chaos for you, just picture every cave collapsing or filling with water. And hey, let's not forget about the continental faults and mountain ranges. They're buckling, separating, and sliding into the freaking ocean. No biggie, right?

Oh, and just to top it all off, volcanoes are erupting left and right, spewing magma into the sky.

So yeah, sure, everything is just peachy. No need to worry, folks. We're totally okay. Can you sense my sarcasm? Good. Because we are so screwed.
------
Dude, seriously? Are you really that dense? I was just throwing out some facts about Nintendo using P2P for online play and other services. I wasn't looking for some big-ass debate or argument. Can't I just mention something without it turning into a freakin' showdown?

I mean, sure, people can argue against what I said, that's cool, but why the hell would I waste my time arguing against a point I actually agree with? Like, seriously, what am I supposed to tell them? "Oh yeah, you're right, fuck Nintendo"? Wow, brilliant contribution there, buddy!

Let's try to have some actual discussion here, instead of just trying to one-up each other with witty remarks. How about we focus on the topic at hand and share some interesting perspectives? That would be way more productive, don't you think?
------
I mean, seriously? Israel's claim about Iran's nuclear program is just a load of crap. They keep going on and on about it, but they never show any real evidence. And now they're pulling this stunt of not releasing evidence to the public and expecting us to just believe them? Give me a break!

And don't even get me started on the IAEA. Who knows what kind of shady business they're involved in? They probably refused to inspect the evidence because they know it's all a bunch of lies. I wouldn't trust them as far as I can throw them.

But hey, let's all just sit back and wait for the IAEA's statement. Yeah, right. Like they're gonna tell us anything useful. They'll probably just try to cover their own asses and protect their precious international reputation.

And as for Western Europe, why should they care? Iran is a regional threat, not their problem. They're too busy sipping wine and eating cheese while the world goes to hell. Typical. Don't forget how their indifference caused so much death and destruction in the past. They never learn, do they?
------
Honestly, I don't get why people have to complicate running form tutorials so much. Like, seriously, it's not rocket science. I've been seeing all these videos from these so-called fast runners, and they're like, "This is how you should run!" Well, guess what? Not everyone can run like that! I mean, if you're a beginner or you're a bit on the heavier side, it's just not realistic to expect you to be sprinting like a dang cheetah.

So here's my advice for all you newbies out there: forget about those long strides and focus on moving those feet quick under your dang hips. Yeah, it might feel like you're shuffling like a penguin, but who cares? You gotta start somewhere, right? It's all about safety, my friends.

So stop stressing over trying to run like some Olympic athlete and just do your thing. Trust me, you'll get better in no time. Now get off your lazy butt and start shuffling those feet!
------
Honestly, I don't get why they're wasting time on a stupid Netflix show and comic for this game. It's obviously just a lame marketing tactic to hype up the new game. They're trying to build up some buzz and get us all excited before they drop the actual game on us. It's so obvious, right? And seriously, when are they gonna announce this year's virtual item for Diablo? Every year they give us some dumb cosmetic crap, so I can't wait to see what they come up with this time. There are just too many unanswered questions at this point. But hey, regardless of all the bullshit, I'm still super pumped for BlizzCon this year. Can't wait to see what they have in store for us.
------
I mean, seriously? Who gives a flying f**k about your partner's weird kinks? It's their business and if they want to keep it to themselves, let them be. Just because you're dating someone doesn't mean you have to know every single thing that turns them on. Get over yourself. And even if they do tell you about it, so what? As long as it's not hurting anyone or involving others without consent, why should it matter? People have different fantasies, and if they're happy just keeping it in their head, then let them be. Unless it's a dealbreaker for you or they go behind your back to fulfill their desires, who cares? Mind your own damn business and stop being so judgmental. Live and let live, man.
------
Damn dude, you must be frickin' starving! If you've hit a damn plateau in your fat loss journey and you're desperate to shed more pounds, here's what you gotta do. Slowly bump up your calorie intake to your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE), hold on to that for a week or two, and then gradually drop back down to about <phone> calories below your TDEE. But hey, don't even think about going below 1000 calories, no matter how tempting it might be.

Oh, and don't forget to factor in your workout routine when calculating your TDEE, along with the usual lifestyle adjustments (like being a couch potato or whatever). Keeping an eye on your macros will help, but it ain't gonna make or break your progress.

Hey, I apologize if I'm talking down to you or going overboard with the explanations. I have no idea how much you're into fitness, bro. So yeah, that's my two cents!
------
Rank choice voting is a great idea. It gives voters more options and allows for a wider range of political perspectives to be represented. And don't even get me started on gerrymandering. That shit is straight up undemocratic and just serves to keep the same old cronies in power. It's time for some real change in this country. We need politicians who actually listen to the people and work towards solutions, not just toeing the party line. But let's be real here, that's probably wishful thinking. The whole system is rigged to benefit those in power, and they'll do whatever it takes to maintain their stranglehold. It's frustrating as hell. But hey, at least we can vent about it on Reddit, right?

Lol, are you serious right now? T'Challa's decision to let Killmonger live had nothing to do with pity or wanting to strengthen his position. It was just a dumb move fueled by stupid pride. I mean, come on! Killmonger literally tried to take over Wakanda and threatened the lives of its people. But oh no, let's just spare him because we feel bad for him. Yeah, great logic there, T'Challa. And don't even get me started on his so-called skills. The dude got his butt kicked by Killmonger without the Black Panther powers. Talk about weak sauce. The whole thing was a major screw-up and T'Challa should have smacked some sense into himself. But hey, what do I know? I'm just a casual Redditor here, pointing out the obvious idiocy.

Dude, seriously? Your response to OP was completely off-base and unnecessary. Who cares if his tires had cooled down or not? It's not like road tires are going to magically fail just because they're not scorching hot. And let's be real, even if his tires were cold, if he had the skills and technique, he could still handle that turn like a boss.

You need to take a step back and read the comments from people who actually know what they're talking about. They explained it perfectly, with the whole acceleration unloading the front tire thing and OP being too stiff on the bars. That's the real reason he went down, not because of some stupid tire temperature.

So next time, before you start spewing your so-called knowledge, maybe educate yourself on the subject first. And for the love of all things good, don't be such an asshole about it. Nobody likes a know-it-all jerk.

Is the American definition of middle class even worth talking about? I mean, seriously, it just seems like a fancy term to keep us peons fighting amongst ourselves. This article tries to touch on it, saying that once you realize you're part of a struggling class, you might vote with others in the same boat. But hold up, the whole point of calling yourself middle class is to avoid that realization and pretend you're better off than you really are.

And then they talk about middle-class and working-class people voting together for a common cause. Are they seriously trying to say that the middle class doesn't have to work? Last time I checked, everyone in America needs to work to make a living, so why create this false divide? Americans seem to think "working class" means "pathetic losers," and that's the problem right there. Until the working class stops looking down on themselves, nothing is gonna get fixed.

Sure, some of the analysis in this piece might be valid, but the way they throw around these terms just perpetuates the division.
------
Wow, you really have no clue what you're talking about, do you? It's clear that you're just trying to twist my words and make yourself feel superior. I never said anything about anarchy and capitalism being the same, so stop putting words in my mouth. And don't even get me started on your ridiculous argument about regulations. Of course capitalism needs regulations to function properly. Just look at history and see all the times when unregulated capitalism led to disaster. But I guess you're too blinded by your own ideology to see the truth. And bringing up murder laws? Seriously? That's just a desperate attempt to muddy the waters and avoid the real discussion. Maybe next time, try actually listening to what someone is saying instead of trying to win a pointless argument.

Bro, let me tell you something about m43 cameras and their low light capabilities. Now, I know they may not be the traditional low light champs like those full-frame monsters, but they got some tricks up their sleeves. Take my E-M1 II with the 12-40mm lens, for example. I can snap crazy sharp handheld shots at 2 seconds exposure without even needing a damn wall to lean on. And don't even get me started on the 12-100mm lens with dual IS. People out here pulling off 12 and even 20-second handheld exposures like it's no biggie! So, you can totally leave your tripod at home, my dude.

But, hold up! Don't get too excited. The truth is, autofocus in low light sucks on these bad boys. Yeah, it's a bummer. But if you're willing to sacrifice some snappy AF for the freedom of shooting handheld in the dark, then m43 might just be your jam.
------
Okay, seriously, I don't get why people are even debating whether or not weed should be marketed. Like, come on! We all know it's gonna happen eventually, so why waste our time arguing about it? And let's be real here, marketing is just a bunch of mind games to make you buy shit you don't need. Do we really want that for weed? It's not like we need some fancy ad to tell us if we want to smoke or not. We should just have the facts and make our own damn decisions.

And don't even get me started on the whole "think of the children" argument. Yeah, I get it, we don't want kids smoking weed before they're old enough, but that's why we have age restrictions and regulations in place. It's not like ads are gonna turn every middle schooler into pot-smoking hippies. Give me a break!

So let's stop wasting our time on this nonsense and focus on more important things. Like how to get the government to finally legalize it everywhere. That's what really matters.
------
Honestly, I don't get why this dude keeps comparing My Hero Academia to Attack on Titan. They're completely different shows with different storylines, so why even bring it up? Like, we get it, you're more hyped for AOT right now, no need to shove it in our faces three freaking times.

Sure, both shows are going through some weak arcs at the moment, but they're weak in their own unique ways. MHA is just going through some licensing exam crap, while AOT is dropping mind-blowing plot developments. The reason people think MHA's arc is weak is because the manga had wonky pacing and Isayama decided to shake things up for the anime.

But seriously, can we just appreciate each show for what it is instead of constantly comparing them? They're both awesome in their own ways, so let's just enjoy them without all this unnecessary drama. Sheesh.
------
equality-under-the-law (de jure) and equality-in-practice (de facto), my dude, they ain't cut from the same cloth. You're over here acting like they're one and the same, but nah, they're different beasts.

Now, let's get real about de jure for a sec:

How 'bout them rapists, huh? It's mind-boggling how these rich white boys or football stars can straight up get away with just a slap on the wrist. Talk about some messed up justice, right?

And don't even get me started on those political parties. They're out here attacking women's right to control their own damn bodies. Like, why you gotta make it so damn hard for women to exercise their basic reproductive rights? It's all these anti-science, bullshit hoops they're making 'em jump through in certain states.

But hey, instead of playing by your rules, let's step off that restricted battlefield, shall we? How 'bout we start talking about the real issues? Like how our oh-so-great Republican president thinks it's okay to repeatedly sexually assault women. Yeah, that's right, I said it.

Oh, and don't even get me started on those angry, dateless dudes shooting innocent women. Like, seriously bro? Can we please address the toxic entitlement and misogyny there?

And let's not forget about the jerks who still cling onto sexist trash like women being naturally submissive or bad at math. It's time to call out that sexist nonsense once and for all.

So yeah, let's cut the crap and have a real conversation about the messed up stuff happening out there.
------
Wow, I can't believe you actually think the defense attorney should decide whether or not their client is guilty. Are you serious? That's just plain dumb. See, the defense attorney's job is to defend their client, no matter what. It's not their job to play judge and jury. They're just there to make sure their client gets a fair trial, whether they're guilty or not. And trust me, they'll do whatever it takes to get their scumbag clients off the hook. It's called doing their damn job. So stop being so naive and thinking that defense attorneys should be these moral superheroes. They're just lawyers doing their job, period. If you don't like it, tough luck. That's how our justice system works. Deal with it.
------
Honestly, I don't give a damn about your opinion on property rights. Who cares if "normal" people own land in the US and rich folks own it in other countries? It's called capitalism, deal with it. If I own a piece of land, you better believe I don't want any random person stepping foot on it without my permission. That's just common sense, not fear. 

But let's move on from that crap and talk about your so-called moral axioms. Who even uses those fancy terms? Look, ethics is pretty simple. It's about doing what feels right to you, plain and simple. I don't need some philosophical mumbo-jumbo to tell me what's right and wrong. Just follow your gut and don't be a jerk. It's not rocket science, people.

So, to sum it up, I couldn't care less about your property rights lecture. And as for your moral axioms, save that highfalutin talk for someone who actually gives a damn. Just do what feels right and stop overcomplicating things. Peace out!
------
Seriously, people need to get their facts straight before they start ranting about this "right to repair" nonsense. No one is stopping you from tinkering with your own phone that you supposedly own. But let's be real here, if you don't know what you're doing and you mess up your precious iPhone, that's on you, buddy. Apple doesn't owe you anything if you decide to play Mr. Fix-It and end up making things worse. And don't even get me started on these so-called "untrained amateurs" who think they can magically repair phones just because they watched a YouTube tutorial. Seriously, stop expecting Apple to cater to your incompetence. If you want to take the risk and do your own repairs, go ahead. But don't come crying to Apple when you screw it up. That's all I gotta say.
------
I seriously don't get why you're rambling about cancers and the environment here. This thread is about something completely different, dude. Get with the program! But whatever, I'll bite.

Yeah, sure, there are things you can do to maybe lower your chances of getting cancer, but let's be real, a lot of it comes down to pure bad luck or good ol' genetics. And yeah, Europe might be all about those "tight environmental controls" and whatnot, but like, do they really expect us to just stop everything and shut down every industry? That's not how the real world works, my friend. We need industry to keep our society running, for better or worse.

So in a nutshell, yeah, Europe might be trying to clean up its act and minimize the harm caused by pollution and stuff. But honestly, it's a never-ending battle, and we're all just paying the price for the comforts we enjoy. So let's quit pretending that we can magically eliminate all pollution and diseases. It ain't gonna happen, so deal with it.
------
Seriously, how can anyone buy into this nonsense? This article is just a load of crap written by some clueless woman who has no idea how real relationships work. Let me tell you, in the real world, 90% of men in dead bedrooms actually appreciate their wives and are desperate to fix things. But no, this genius author thinks that all it takes is for the man to "recourt" his wife and everything magically gets better. Yeah, right!

I mean, come on, this is obviously just some woman's delusional thinking trying to rationalize her own messed up preferences and behavior. And surprise, surprise, it's from "The Morning Night Program" where they probably dish out a bunch of equally ridiculous advice. Don't waste your time listening to or reading this garbage, people. Trust me, I've got a hall pass with other women, so I know what I'm talking about.
------
lol are you serious? Buildings flying in Starcraft 2 is a freaking joke. It's like watching a bunch of chickens with jetpacks. And sure, maybe BW was slower, but at least it made more sense. Like, you had to actually strategize and plan your moves instead of just picking up your base and flying away whenever things got tough. And don't even get me started on that "cheapens the experience" crap. It's just a lazy excuse for bad game design. If you can't handle the fact that buildings fly, maybe you should stick to checkers or something. And as for the maps, yeah, they could do a better job, but let's be real here, it's not the map makers' fault that Blizzard decided to add this ridiculous mechanic. So yeah, sorry, but I gotta call BS on this one.
------
Okay, so listen up guys. I gotta vent about this permastealth deadeye bullshit that's been ruining my game lately. Like seriously, how the hell are you supposed to fight someone you can't even see? It's so frustrating, especially when you're in a big open area and this sneaky bastard just pops out of nowhere and one-shots your sorry ass. And don't even get me started on those classes that don't have a stealth reveal skill - it's practically impossible for them. 

I mean, I usually don't complain about balance issues, but come on. This is just straight-up annoying. Half the players in Eternal Battlegrounds were losing their minds trying to figure out if that deadeye was still creeping around the inner castle (spoiler alert: he totally was). And get this, people actually wasted precious castle supplies on stealth traps just to try and catch this slippery thief.

So here's the thing, what the hell are these deadeyes using to maintain this permastealth nonsense? Is there some secret trait or utility skill I'm missing? Because, honestly, it feels like there's zero counter-play to this crap. I was playing my mesmer spamming Greatsword skill 5 like a maniac, but it did jack shit against this invisible deadeye. Ugh, someone please tell me I'm not alone in thinking this is a major problem.
------
Wow, you really have no idea what you're talking about, do you? It's like you just stumbled upon the internet yesterday. First off, comparing social media platforms to utilities is just plain idiotic. Are you seriously saying that not having Twitter or Facebook is equivalent to living under a dictatorship? Get a grip. And newsflash, these companies absolutely have the right to define what free speech is on their platforms. It's called terms of service, ever heard of it? If you can't follow their rules, tough luck, they have every right to ban your sorry ass. Maybe instead of throwing around big words like "freedom of speech," you should actually understand what it means. Try reading up on it before embarrassing yourself further. Here's a link for you, since you clearly need some education: <url>. Don't worry, I won't hold my breath for you to actually read it.
------
Honestly, it's so frustrating when people think they're the kings of the road and refuse to follow basic traffic laws. Like seriously, why is it so hard to understand that you should yield to someone who wants to go faster than you? It's not rocket science! Germany gets it right by not having speed limits in certain areas, but still managing to have safer roads than us. Maybe if everyone actually followed the traffic laws for just one day, we could see some positive changes. But let's be real, it's never gonna happen because there's always gonna be that one idiot driving 60 in the passing lane like they own the place. I swear, these people are creating a more dangerous situation than someone who wants to go a little over the limit. Ugh, don't even get me started on speed limits being based on crappy old cars. Can we please just have some common sense and courtesy on the road for once?
------
Man, I don't understand why everyone's making such a big deal about this wrestler being champ. Like seriously, it's not like it means anything for his future. People are saying it's some sort of desperate move to keep him from leaving. But let's be real, if he wants to leave, they can just take the belt off him without any problem. It's not rocket science.

And don't even get me started on the Montreal Screwjob. Yeah, yeah, it was a shady move and all that, but come on, plenty of promotions have done similar stuff. WWE, WCW, you name it. Giving belts to guys with expiring contracts is nothing new. So why are we acting like it's such a big shock? It's all just part of the game, man.

Also, shoutout to NJPW for having a contingency plan in case this dude decides to bail. They learned from WWE's mistake with Lesnar after Mania. So, whether he stays or goes, they got it covered. No need to stress, people!
------
Alright, so here's my take on this shitty chapter. Jon Snow thinks he's some badass hero who's gonna take on Ramsay Bolton to save his precious sister and the wildling dude. Like seriously, who does he think he is? And then we got George R.R. Martin pulling some cheap tricks with his writing. "They talked for the best part of two hours." Really? That's all we get? Thanks for nothing, Martin. Could've at least given us some juicy details instead of leaving us in the dark. But hey, I guess that's what he wants, keeping us guessing and shit. This whole chapter is just a mess, full of mystery and drama for no good reason. Martin's prose is so damn confusing, like he's trying to sound all fancy and shit. Well, newsflash, it ain't working. Just give us the damn story already, without all this obfuscating bullshit. But hey, you do you, Martin. YMMV, I guess.
------
Seriously, why does anyone even care about this crap? I mean, come on, why the hell is there some stupid policy that says Elon Musk's employees will get the boot if they test positive for drugs? Shouldn't he have to follow the same damn rules? It's not like he's some god or something.

And let's talk about this whole smoking weed and dating Grimes thing. It just reeks of desperation. Like, dude, were you such a loser in school that now you're trying to be the cool kid by puffing on a joint and hooking up with some musician? It's like he's having a pathetic midlife crisis.

I don't know about you, but finding out that Elon Musk smokes weed definitely didn't make him any cooler in my book. I mean, who the hell cares? But what really gets me is that people have actually been fired from Tesla for doing the exact same thing he did. That's when it becomes a problem and we should start giving a damn.
------
Man, that landing was a mess. Small aircraft just can't handle it like the big boys. Flaring? Ha, forget about it. They pretty much just go from flying to slow-ass flight or even stalling. No fancy weight to help them slow down gracefully like those airlines. 

And did you see that dirt road he flew right over? It looked hard packed and totally usable. He should have held that nose off longer and bleed off some more of that excessive airspeed. 

But hey, at least he could have started by pitching up to his best glide speed and then looked for a decent place to land. Maybe even gone through a quick checklist to make sure everything was in order. You know, like fuel supply, selector, all that important stuff.

I mean, I get it, it's easy for us armchair pilots to say what he should have done. We're not in the heat of the moment, feeling all nervous and shit. At least no one got hurt and the plane is replaceable.
------
Dude, seriously? You're talking so much crap right now, it's ridiculous. First off, let me explain to you how you're completely off topic. You claimed that "nazi" isn't a racial slur, and I took the time to explain why I believe it is. And what's your counter-argument? *Farts into a microphone*? Are you kidding me? That's the best you got?

And let's not forget how you're defending some dude who clearly has some Nazi vibes going on. Like, seriously? Nobody has been able to prove that u/ultimaregem is a freaking Nazi? Have you even looked at the evidence? It's staring you right in the face!

Oh, and by the way, just because I'm white doesn't mean I give a damn about your whiteness. Newsflash, buddy, anyone can be racist against their own race. Look at Antifa for example, they're a prime example of that. And don't even get me started on how you keep defending those losers.

But hey, don't take my word for it, here's a link to you defending Antifa repeatedly. Go ahead, embarrass yourself some more. (<url>)
------
Hey, thanks for your suggestions! We checked out Norrebro while we were there and even stayed in an Airbnb in that area. We had a great meal at this spot called Spisestedet - definitely recommend it!

Hiring a boat sounds like a solid plan for the next trip. Can't go wrong with some boating fun, right?

I'm all about trying local food too, and Copenhagen was just loaded with cool little bars and cafes that weren't those boring chain places. I'll have to make sure Kobyen is on my list for next time!

And yeah, it's pretty crazy how fluent Danes are in English. I mean, I don't speak a lick of Danish, but these guys in a bar would be chatting away in Danish and then randomly switch to English. Is English practically a second language over there or what? It's mind-boggling!
------
Dude, seriously? You're gonna get all butthurt over a harmless comment? Talk about being sensitive. Tremu wasn't even talking to you directly, but you just had to take it personally and throw some insults back. Way to go, genius.

Listen up, if you want any shot at finding a girlfriend, maybe start by not being such a jerk. I mean, come on, no one wants to be with someone who's constantly acting like an asshole. It's common sense, man.

And hey, here's a little nugget of advice for you: maybe try washing your face once in a while. I mean, seriously, it's not that hard. I bet you're one of those guys who hasn't seen a bar of soap in years. Gross.

But hey, if you're already doing that, good for you, I guess. Just make sure you're not driving potential partners away with that charming personality of yours. Trust me, being a decent person goes a long way.

Anyway, take it or leave it, but maybe consider taking a chill pill and actually listening to the advice instead of getting all defensive. Just saying.
------
Wow, you really missed the whole point of my comment, didn't you? I mean, come on, it's not that hard to understand. I can't believe I even have to explain this to you. I was clearly talking about why people get mad about comparisons, and you went off on some random tangent about being mad or not being mad. Seriously, do you even read before you respond? And don't give me that crap about not being able to judge tone in text. If you had any common sense, you would know that context matters. But I guess that's asking too much from you. So next time, try to actually comprehend what someone is saying before you go off on your little self-righteous rants.
------
So I'm just casually chilling at the tattoo parlor, getting some ink done, right? And I start chatting with my artist about all the crazy shit they have to deal with. We both look over and notice this poor dude next to us getting his fourth wrist tattoo of the day. Can you believe it? People just walking in like it's nothing, asking for simple-ass designs like a damn date or a feather. And they're all like, "No color, no details, keep it basic." Are you kidding me? Like, why even bother? 

Anyway, I was supposed to be done after four hours, but the guy after me flaked, so my artist and I were like, "Screw it, let's keep going!" And that's when we really started paying attention to the clients he had throughout the day. Most of them didn't want anything cool or unique added to their lame ideas. It's like they have no imagination or something. But hey, it made for some hilarious entertainment while I was getting my own sick ink done. Good times, man.
------
Seriously? Can we please stop with all this Captain Marvel hype? I mean, yeah, she's powerful and all that, but let's not get ahead of ourselves and start calling her the "most powerful hero yet" in the MCU. Like come on, she's not even close to being as badass as the Hulk or Thor. And don't even get me started on Doctor Strange. That guy can literally manipulate reality! 

Sure, there may be some comic storyline where she takes on the Hulk, but who cares? It's just one story among many. Writers can make any hero as powerful as they want for a specific plot. So let's not act like Captain Marvel is unbeatable or anything. She's just another superhero trying to do her thing. The MCU has plenty of other amazing heroes who deserve recognition too. So let's keep it real and stop overhyping Captain Marvel, alright?
------
Damn, this topic is a freaking mess. First off, who the hell cares about some outdated war like WWII? Like seriously, get over it already. But since you brought it up, let's talk about these nukes. Some people think it was a total dick move, but they clearly don't know crap. Yeah, sure, dropping two frickin' atomic bombs sounds pretty harsh, but did you idiots even consider the alternatives?

If we didn't nuke Japan, we would've had to invade, and that would've been a total bloodbath. I'm talking millions of casualties, man! And that's just military folks, not even counting innocent civilians who would've been caught in the crossfire. Plus, the Japanese were taught some messed up stuff, like death before capture and all that crazy honorable stuff.

So yeah, the nukes sucked, but they saved lives in the long run. The firebombing of Tokyo killed way more people and destroyed tons of buildings, but people conveniently forget about that. And let's face it, Japan was no joke when it came to defending their turf.

So if you ask me, dropping those nukes was a tough but necessary decision. The uninformed crowd needs to educate themselves before jumping on the hate train. But hey, that's just my two cents. Don't get your panties in a bunch if you disagree. Peace out!
------
Wow, seriously? Are you even reading what I'm saying? I never said all Italians are responsible for these incidents. I'm just presenting evidence to show that the UN is justified in taking action. And you, on the other hand, are being completely ignorant by denying that any discrimination is happening. Like, come on, do you think a freaking 13-month-old baby is part of some crime syndicate?

And don't even get me started on Salvini. He made it clear during his election campaign that he wants to kick out all the Roma from Italy. How can you support that? What makes you think you have more right to live there than a Roma child born and raised in Italy? Newsflash, buddy, they have just as much right as you do.

So stop trying to make this about some "sjw alt-left" nonsense. This is about facing the facts and not treating people like garbage just because they aren't Italian. It's called basic human decency, but I guess that concept is lost on you.
------
Dude, seriously? You're still on this topic? Look, just because I open crates in Rocket League doesn't mean I think cosmetics affect gameplay. They're just for looks, man. I mean, come on, who cares what my car looks like when I'm playing? It's all about skill, not how shiny my wheels are.

And don't even get me started on your excuses. "It doesn't help me shoot things"? Really? That's the best you got? Cosmetics have nothing to do with shooting things or any other gameplay mechanics. They're just there to make your character or whatever look cool or different. It's not rocket science.

And let me ask you something, genius. If cosmetics don't affect gameplay, why do companies charge so much for them? Think about it, man. They're making bank off of people like you who are willing to spend real money on virtual outfits. So yeah, maybe think twice before you start arguing that cosmetics actually matter in a game. Trust me, they don't.
------
Hey, so I totally get what you're saying. It's messed up how many of us have felt uncomfortable because of some dude's unwanted advances or creepy behavior. Like, seriously, it's such a common thing for girls and women to go through. And the worst part is that we're often too scared or unsure to actually stand up for ourselves. It's like we're conditioned to just brush it off and pretend it's all cool, even though it really isn't.

I remember this one time when I was like 16, this older guy kept hitting on me at a party. It made me super uncomfortable, but I didn't want to make a scene or seem like a bitch, so I just laughed it off and tried to avoid him. Looking back, I realize how messed up that was. Why the hell should I have to put up with some loser making me feel like crap? It's messed up that we're taught to obey our elders or some BS like that, instead of being encouraged to stand up for ourselves and know our worth.

But you know what? Screw those creepy dudes. We shouldn't have to tolerate their inappropriate behavior. It's time we empower ourselves and make it clear that we won't put up with their shit anymore.
------
Wow, you must be clueless or just plain dumb if you think you're "turning around" an organization by getting rid of everyone except one person. Maybe it's not the employees who need to step up, but you as a manager who needs a reality check. And please spare us the bragging about how much you pay your "entry level" employees. It's not impressive when you clearly have no clue about what it takes to actually create a positive work environment. Newsflash, buddy: maybe the problem isn't with the young people and their expectations, but with your terrible management skills. Quit blaming others for your own incompetence and start taking responsibility. But hey, who am I kidding? You probably won't even listen because you seem too full of yourself to realize the truth. Good luck with your sinking ship.
------
Yo, what's up with you virgins on here? Y'all assuming shit without even looking at my comment history, damn! I couldn't care less if it's a chick or not. Yeah, I might've come off a bit forceful and rapey with my words (as some users kindly pointed out), but I clearly said if she's refusing help, then back off. But hey, at least make the effort to try and get her some professional help, 'cause from what it sounds like, she wasn't fully aware of the seriousness of her bleeding. Shit could be messed up with her brain, man! Don't any of you idiots know shit about concussions? Fuck sakes! Being nice and trying to help someone who's out of it doesn't automatically mean you're some kind of creep. It's actually just being decent and doing the right thing. Jesus, learn something for once.
------
Disagreeing with your opinion here. It's clear to me that RDA's relentless pressure would overpower Ponzi and prevent any chance of him effectively boxing from long range. Ponzi simply doesn't possess the skills to keep a fighter like RDA at bay. 

Now, let's talk about the judging for a sec. This fight shouldn't be compared to the Colby matchup where he did nothing but hug the wall and stall. RDA actually landed more strikes in the rounds he won. I gotta admit, I'm a huge RDA fan myself and I'd love to do some mental gymnastics to convince myself he won against Colby, but I just can't. For three rounds, RDA was constantly on the backfoot, getting outstruck. It's tough to argue against that.
------
Wow, some people are just too dumb to figure out things on their own. I mean, who in their right mind actually calls customer service for every little problem? It's like they have no intelligence or common sense whatsoever. I've had my fair share of issues with PS hardware, software, and online services, but guess what? I managed to solve them all by myself. All it took was a bit of googling and voila! Problem solved.

Honestly, calling customer service should be the absolute last resort. I've worked in customer service centers before, and let me tell you, those poor souls are already dealing with the worst kind of callers. I'd rather break my back trying to fix something myself than add to their misery. So, next time you encounter an issue, do yourself a favor and use your brain first. Trust me, you'll save everyone a lot of trouble.
------
lol, wtf are you even talking about? Who cares who pays the players in OWL? As long as they're getting paid, who gives a shit? It's not like Blizzard owes them anything. They're just the game developers, not the player's sugar daddy. And comparing it to the NFL? Seriously? That's like comparing apples to oranges. One is a damn video game and the other is a multi-billion dollar sports league. Get real, man.

And why the hell should WOTC be paying players anyway? They're just another game company. It's not their job to pay people to play their game. If players want to get paid, they can go find sponsors or something. It's called the real world, buddy. Companies aren't just gonna hand out cash to every Joe Schmo who plays their game.

So maybe instead of whining about who should be paying the players, how about we focus on the actual game itself? Just a thought.

Dude, seriously? Are you for real? Who gives a flying f*ck about "disclosing" fetishes before marriage and all that crap? People have secret desires and kinks, and it's nobody's damn business whether they choose to reveal them before or after tying the knot. Like, maybe she didn't even know about it herself until recently, who knows? And why should she be judged or made to feel bad for discovering something about herself? Life is messy, man, and relationships are even messier. It's not like she's cheating or doing something harmful, for Christ's sake. So maybe instead of being all high and mighty and clinging onto outdated principles, how about we just support each other and try to understand that people change and explore new things? Just a thought, bro.

Yo, so I stumbled upon this thread and I gotta say, some millennials out there are straight up insane. Like, they actually wanna max out their debt just to have a good time before everything turns to crap? Are you kidding me? I mean, sure, life can be tough and all, but ruining your credit forever? That's just dumb. And don't even get me started on those younger millennials who think the world has always been falling apart. Have they ever heard of optimism?

I get it, life's unpredictable, but seriously, is taking on a mountain of debt the only solution? I'm in my 30s, and yeah, things aren't perfect, but that doesn't mean I'm ready to throw all caution to the wind. I still believe in being responsible and making smart choices for the future. Maybe it's time for these people to grow up and start thinking long-term instead of indulging in instant gratification.

Look, I know life can suck sometimes, but maxing out your debt is not the answer. It's like saying, "Screw my future self, I'll deal with it later." Trust me, that mindset won't get you very far. So, let's try to be a little more sensible, huh?
------
Hey, do you even have a freakin' source to back up your claims? Because if you do, that means one of my examples (which, by the way, was the mildest one) has some friggin' context I never heard of before. So how about those shootings and immigrants being beaten to death? You conveniently ignored that part. And don't get me started on that story about racism. I mean, come on! It was featured in an article talking about the increase in crimes against immigrants in Italy. Obviously, that screams racism to me. And let's not forget the Roma situation. Yeah, yeah, I know discrimination against them happens in other places too, but the Italian government is straight up targeting and scapegoating them. Especially with Salvini's promise to kick them out. So, where's your proof to counter all that? Huh?
------
Dude, don't even get me started on loot boxes in Overwatch. It's like they're trying to suck every penny out of our wallets. And let's not forget that you have to pay to even play the game in the first place! Like, seriously, who does that? And the worst part is, they shove these damn loot boxes in your face constantly, so you're always tempted to buy more, even though 90% of the stuff you get is complete garbage. Sprays, icons, voice lines - who gives a flying f*ck about that crap? The whole system is rigged against us, man. And yeah, you might get lucky and snag a recolor of a basic skin, but come on, that's just a cheap way to make it seem like you're getting something good. They need to take a page from Hearthstone's book and actually give us something of value in those loot boxes. At least card packs in Hearthstone give you five items, and you can actually use the cards for something, instead of just pointless cosmetics.

Yo, so I just got diagnosed with ADHD a few months ago and let me tell you, it's been a rollercoaster ride. On the one hand, when I'm on my meds and my brain has enough dopamine flowing, I'm freaking chill, man. I can actually sit down and do normal stuff like reading or cleaning without feeling like it's the end of the world. But when I'm off my meds, it's a whole different story. My brain is like a squirrel on crack, I'm talkative, jokey, and sometimes even rude. And don't even get me started on chores. I'll straight up ignore them until it becomes a mountain of mess and then spend an entire day or two cleaning like a madman.

See, dopamine is the brain's way of motivating and rewarding you for good behavior. So when I'm on my meds, I've got that chemical motivation boost to get shit done and not be a total jackass. But when I'm off them, I'm all about seeking higher levels of stimulation, which means chores are just about the last thing on my mind. It's like my brain goes from "haha, let me say something silly" to "ugh, I guess I could try reading? Oh wait, those damn dishes need to be done."

Speaking of reading, that used to be a real struggle for me. I'd start a novel and it would take me frickin' forever to finish because I couldn't sustain focus. But thanks to my meds, I can power through a whole book in just a day and a bit. It's wild, man!

So yeah, that's my ADHD experience in a nutshell. It's a mixed bag for sure, but hey, at least I've got my meds to keep me sane(ish).

lol okay so basically planets form cuz of a bunch of gas going fast but not like super fast, just all at the same speed. so they bump into each other and stick together and eventually become big ass rocks. and then more stuff crashes into them and they get even bigger. but they don't just fly apart cuz gravity is like "nah, I got this" and keeps everything together. it's kinda like the planet is spinning but not crazy fast, so gravity wins and stuff doesn't fly off into space. and this happens in solar systems and galaxies and all that cuz there's so much freakin' space between everything. like it takes us forever to get to Mars even going supersonic, so that's plenty of room for stuff to orbit and not just crash into each other. hope that clears things up for ya!
------
Man, I feel you. It's frustrating when you see other dudes at the gym making gains without having to go all out like a maniac. But hey, we're all different, right? Some people just have those lucky genetics that let them grow with regular volume and intensity.

But for us unlucky ones, it seems like we need to hammer our muscles into submission to see any progress. Like you, I noticed that my body parts only respond when I go balls to the wall with insane volume. It's like they're stubborn little jerks that need to be beaten into submission.

I've tried doing the whole "balanced" routine, giving everything equal attention, but it never works for me. My shoulders are okay because of all the overhead pressing, but my chest is a goddamn disaster. Every time I try to hit it hard, my shoulders start acting up and I'm back to square one.

I don't know why we're like this, but I'm glad to know I'm not alone. So, anyone out there with a similar experience? Let's commiserate and maybe figure out some tricks to make these stubborn muscles grow without wrecking ourselves in the process.
------
Yo, check this out. So, I was just doing some random research (aka browsing Wikipedia) and stumbled upon the origin of the word "Dutch." Apparently, it comes from the word "diets," which was a group of languages/dialects spoken in the mid-Netherlands back in the day. But here's the kicker - it's not popular anymore because those dumbasses in the NSB, our very own national socialists, used it as Nazi propaganda during World War II. Can you believe that?

And get this, it's related to the word "Deutsch," which is why people often confuse Dutch with German. Like seriously, can we blame 'em? But hey, shoutout to our royal family for not having anything to do with this mess. I mean, my bad for getting things twisted in my head. But honestly, "Netherlandish" is a better term, you know? The English peeps just never caught on to the fact that it's not "diets" anymore.

By the way, have you noticed how our Euro buddies changed up the term for our language? It's "niederlandisch(ge)," "neerlandais(fra)," "holandes(es)," "olandese(it)," but Scandinavians still chill with calling it Dutch. Go figure.
------
Alright folks, let's cut the crap and get real here. Who even cares about this whole Matt Lauer firing circus? All we've got are a bunch of nameless sources and corporate puppets feeding us their version of the story. They say it was due to "inappropriate behavior," but what does that even mean? It could be anything from a dirty joke to full-blown murder for all we know.

Now let me tell you something, if this guy really did some messed up stuff like rape, why hasn't anyone come forward? I mean, sure, there's a statute of limitations, but money talks, right? People like Stormy Daniels managed to squeeze Trump for a fat check just for some consensual hanky-panky. So why isn't anyone going after Lauer if he's such a high-profile sicko with deep pockets?

Honestly, nowadays guys need a reality check. Some women out there can be pure evil, especially when they team up with ambulance-chasing sharks like Avenatti. It's a crazy world we live in, my friends.
------
Man, have you guys seen Spider-Man in action? That dude is a freakin' powerhouse. I mean, he can lift like 10 tons and he only weighs 170lbs. It's seriously mind-boggling. And let's talk about his jumps, bro. With all that strength in his legs, back, and arms, he could probably launch himself up to like 30ft in the air. Insane, right?

Now, some people have been saying that his webs should be super elastic. But hold up, I think they're missing something. If his webs were too elastic, it would mess up his ability to use them to propel himself. Like, why rely on elasticity when you're already a spider goddess-powered superhuman, you know? He's got enough momentum going on with his own body, so he doesn't need any extra help from bouncy webs.

But hey, I'm no physics expert, so correct me if I'm wrong. Just wanted to share my two cents on this whole Spider-Man physics debate. Keep slingin', Spidey!
------
Hey, I gotta say, your argument is all over the place. You're trying to connect some random dots here. First off, yeah, everyone knows that high-profile people like actors have more rights than some nobody with a low-paying job. That's just how the world works, man. And what's with the whole women's rights thing? How does that even relate to anything? Are you saying that women getting more rights means it's okay to work with sex abusers? That's messed up, dude. 

And seriously, why are you blaming the victim here? So what if this guy paid for his wrongs? That doesn't mean he should just get a free pass and his actions forgotten. You're acting like his life is so important but what about the people he hurt? They don't matter? And stop with the death sentence crap, nobody said anything about that. We're just talking about holding people accountable for their actions. 

Look, I get it. Mental health is important and all that. But don't act like every sex abuser is some poor misunderstood soul who deserves sympathy. Yeah, some of them may have been through messed up stuff themselves, but that doesn't justify what they did. And no, I'm not gonna feel sorry for someone who ruins their own life by being a creep. Society has to draw a line somewhere, man, and protecting victims should always come first.
------
Okay, listen up you whiny bunch of self-righteous pricks. I wouldn't give two shits about flicking a cigarette butt or chucking an apple core off a hiking trail. It's not like it's gonna cause the damn apocalypse or anything. And as for you holier-than-thou non-smokers, just because you don't smoke doesn't mean you're exempt from being litterbugs yourselves. I've seen plenty of you assholes tossing trash around like it's nobody's business. So quit acting like smokers are the scum of the earth.

And don't even get me started on this whole "smokers think they're above the law" crap. It's not about that. Some people just don't give a flying fuck about the rules, whether they smoke or not. It's a universal human trait, not a damn smoker exclusive. So quit acting like you're all high and mighty just because you follow every little law and regulation.

Oh, and before you start spewing your bullshit about military discipline, let me tell you something. I'd love to see you try your argument with a senior NCO in any military branch. They'll tear you a new one and show you what real discipline looks like. So stop acting like you know it all, you ignorant twats.

End of rant.
------
Dude, seriously? You're completely blowing things out of proportion here. Nobody said any of the shit you're quoting. You're just making stuff up in your head and getting all worked up over nothing.

The person was simply questioning how showing kids a video of their idol getting groped is supposed to teach them a lesson. They weren't attacking Ariana or saying she should've done anything differently. It's just about understanding how this video is meant to teach something when it could easily send the message that you're supposed to just let it happen.

And let me make this clear, he didn't say the victim didn't act right or that the lesson isn't effective because of it. You completely twisted his words. Asking how something makes sense or how a lesson is effective isn't the same as saying it doesn't make sense or the lesson is useless. You're just being overly sensitive for no reason.
------
I gotta say, Sony really needs to loosen up their attitude. I mean, come on, they're acting all high and mighty like Apple with their elitist stance. It's ridiculous. Microsoft is at least willing to consider cross platform servers between consoles, but no, not Sony. They're too exclusive for that kind of cooperation. It's frustrating how unwilling they are to work alongside other companies.

And let me tell you, I was shocked when they actually allowed Spider-Man to join the MCU. I bet it wouldn't have happened if Andrew Garfield didn't screw up as Spidey. Sony probably didn't have any other choice. But hey, I still love both Sony and Apple, I just wish they would stop acting like they're above everyone else.
------
Are you seriously questioning this? It's pretty basic knowledge that if the jesus nut disengages, the blades won't just magically detach from the helicopter. They will still be connected to the swash plate and spinning freely. The motor won't be engaged, duh! And yeah, during auto rotation, you adjust the pitch of the blades using the swash plate to spin them at high speeds and then create lift by adjusting the pitch again to slow down your descent. I mean, come on, even I know this and I'm not a chopper pilot or anything. But hey, if you want a more professional answer, why don't you try asking the folks over at r/helicopters? Maybe they can enlighten you with their expert knowledge.
------
Yo, listen up y'all. So, I just came across these articles that claim China is all fascist and stuff. Like seriously? Who comes up with this crap? I mean sure, China may have its own way of doing things, but that doesn't automatically make them fascist. It's just some good ol' American exceptionalism at play here, where we think everyone should bow down to our standards and beliefs.

But hey, it's not just me saying this. There's a whole bunch of Americans out there who actually buy into this nonsense. I know, right? It's mind-boggling. Like, some folks even go as far as equating not standing for the national anthem to treason. Can you believe it?

Anyway, my point is, just because another culture doesn't adhere to our oh-so-perfect metrics doesn't make them evil or fascist. We gotta step back and realize that people are different, and that's okay. So, let's put an end to this baseless labeling, yeah? Peace out!
------
I mean, come on, dude. What's the big fuss about wireless anyway? It's not like it causes any wear and tear or physical damage. The packets come straight from my computer and the bandwidth is provided by the carrier. And let's be real, unused bandwidth doesn't have any value whatsoever. So who's really losing out here? The only ones making a big deal are the carriers and the frickin' judicial system, because they have to provide the bandwidth and you're hiding your IP. But seriously, if I put myself in the shoes of the person whose internet was used, what did they really lose? I wouldn't want some random person in my house causing a fuss, even if it's just a small impact. And don't even get me started on privacy concerns. Who knows what kind of personal stuff they could snoop around while they're at it. So yeah, I don't see the parallel with physical land use either, man.
------
First of all, I gotta say, this whole thing sounds like a bunch of hogwash to me. So, these mice live in enclosures that are cleaned with some so-called "harsh detergent" and that magically releases BPA? Come on, give me a break! And then they have the audacity to say that these mice have higher exposure than any humans? Seriously? How do they even know that? Did they go around measuring BPA levels in every single human on the planet? I highly doubt it.

And let's not forget about the fact that they claim it's specifically BPA or its replacement causing the problem. How do they know it's not something else in the plastic, the detergents, or even the food? Did they find actual BPA molecules interfering with sperm production? I highly doubt that too. Sounds more like a wild goose chase to me.

Oh, and they mention that other researchers in their facility don't see the impact. Well, maybe that's because there is no impact! Just saying.
------
Man, gotta disagree with you there. AJ Styles may not have had the long reigns like Okada and Tanahashi, but he still made a huge impact in NJPW. He brought his own unique style to the company and had some amazing matches. And yeah, maybe he wasn't the "guy" like Okada, but he held the title to keep the feuds going and build up those rivalries. Plus, let's not forget his epic matches against Nakamura and Ibushi. As for Kenny, yeah, he's great and all, but let's not jump the gun and call him the new ace just yet. Okada's still the man, and he'll be around for a while. Kenny's definitely one of the pillars, but let's give credit where it's due. AJ Styles was no emergency heel main eventer. He left a lasting impact on NJPW.
------
OMG, have you seen the latest news about those conservative justices supposed to be on Trump's side? They can't even give him what he wants! What a joke. And you know who he really needs? Kavanaugh, that's right. He's the only one who's openly supported Trump and his shady stuff. Can you believe Trump is trying to push through a candidate with such a sketchy record? It's like he doesn't care if judges are respected or not.

And guess what? There's actually proof that Kavanaugh lied about his involvement in the torture program. I mean, seriously, how is this guy even being considered for the Supreme Court? It's a freaking disaster waiting to happen. I found this article that fact-checks everything, it's insane. Check it out: <insert URL>

But hey, what can we expect from Trump at this point, right? He always seems to surround himself with controversy. It's just one big circus.
------
Seriously? You think the government is going to solve all our problems? That's a load of crap. The government can't even fix a pothole, let alone address racial extremists. It's not their damn responsibility, it's ours as individuals. We need to stand up against these morons ourselves instead of relying on some incompetent politicians to do it for us. And don't even get me started on the CIA and FBI. Those guys are too busy spying on innocent people and covering up their own shady activities to give a damn about racial extremists. So, stop living in la-la land and thinking the government will save the day. It's time to take matters into our own hands and show these racists that we won't tolerate their BS.
------
Look, I get it. Hurricanes can be scary as hell, especially if you've never experienced one before. And I'm not gonna lie, being in the middle of a major storm is no joke. So don't beat yourself up for wanting to leave.

But here's the thing, even if these idiots somehow manage to survive, you gotta think about yourself too. Are you really willing to risk missing that job interview just to play hero? I wouldn't. The roads could be a total shitshow after the storm, and you'll be stuck twiddling your thumbs while everyone else is trying to get their lives back on track.

So my advice? Encourage them to GTFO if there's an evacuation order. If they choose to stay and embrace their stupidity, that's on them. But you don't have to be a part of their idiotic plan. Take care of yourself and get the hell outta there.
------
I don't get the hype around this place. I mean, seriously, what's the big deal with these donuts? Everyone acts like they're some kind of culinary masterpiece, but let's be real here, they're just average at best. I've had way better donuts from my local bakery down the street, and they don't have tourists lining up around the block for them. And don't even get me started on Salt and Straw. Yeah, the ice cream is alright, but waiting in line for hours just to get a scoop? Are you kidding me? The founder's idea of creating a sense of community is a load of crap. No one talks to each other in line, it's just a bunch of people glued to their phones. So yeah, I call BS on all the hype surrounding these places. They're overrated and not worth the wait.
------
Man, are you seriously still talking about this? Who cares about all this salary cap hit and total cash nonsense? At the end of the day, Brady takes discounts, okay? Yeah, maybe he didn't do it his whole career, but so what? He's still willing to take less money for the team. And let's not forget, he signed his biggest contract ever AFTER marrying Gisele. So all that talk about him only doing it for her is just BS. Plus, he's not gonna be the highest paid QB at 41 years old, like duh! Context matters when it comes to contracts, people! Can we please move on from this already? Brady's a great QB, period.
------
So, I gotta be real here. Dual slots ain't a dealbreaker for me when it comes to shooting professionally. Yeah, sure, it's nice to have, but let's not get all crazy about it. I mean, c'mon, there are other things to consider, like using those Sony cameras that drive me nuts. People don't talk enough about the artistic and technical aspects of photography. Being in tune with your gear is what really matters, ya know? I might be going off on a tangent, but seriously, don't base your buying decisions on some minor feature. There's way more important stuff to think about, and most of it can't be found on some spec sheet. So, chill out, folks.
------
I don't get why people keep whining about losing money for a couple of weeks. Like, seriously? Is that the end of the world for you? There are way bigger problems out there, so stop being so damn entitled. And let's not act like these creators are always in the right. Just because they think their content is gold doesn't mean it actually is. So many of them deserve to have their videos taken down. And yeah, sure, there might be a few cases where takedown notices are used unfairly, but that's just the nature of the beast. It's not like Google can magically know who's right and wrong every single time. So quit your complaining and get over it. There are more important things to worry about in life.
------
Yo, hold up. You're saying sympathy hormones and using your body to sustain life are not the same? Come on, man. That's some weak argument right there. And don't even get me started on this whole "what is life" crap. We ain't got time for that philosophical mumbo jumbo. 

You're bringing up kids and teenagers depending on their parents as if it's the same thing as being a living being inside someone's womb. Are you serious? Like, sure, they depend on their parents, but they're out in the world, capable of surviving on their own. But a fetus? It's literally inside someone's body, depending on the mother to keep it alive. That's a whole different level of dependence, my dude.

And don't even try to argue that this hormonal reaction only happens with women. Doctors and male relatives don't experience it? Well, excuse me, Mr. Expert, but that's just plain ignorance. Testosterone doesn't magically make you immune to feeling sympathetic towards someone, especially if it's your own kid. So let's not go throwing around unfounded claims, alright?
------
Alright, let me just say this straight up - Spiderman 2 was good, but this new game blows it out of the water. I mean, seriously, execution is everything and this game nails it. I know it's been a hot minute since I played Spiderman 2, but from what I remember, this game takes the whole structure to a whole new level.

And can we please stop with the whole "it's just a rehash" nonsense? The combat, stealth, and story approach in this game are on a whole other level. Sure, it may have taken some inspiration from Arkham Asylum, but who cares? Combining the best parts of two amazing superhero games is no easy task, my friend.

So, those high scores this game has been getting? Yeah, totally well-deserved. This game is an absolute banger and anyone who thinks otherwise clearly hasn't played it or just has terrible taste. Keep slinging through those New York City streets, Spidey!
------
Alright, listen up you bunch of internet trolls. Social media marketers these days are so damn sneaky. They throw out these random tidbits to make you go, "Hmm, how can I get that? How did they do it?" It's all about making you feel like you discovered something on your own, when in reality, you've been played like a fiddle.

And then, in the comments section, someone has the audacity to straight up ask the poster for more information. And of course, the original poster just loves to show off and spill the beans. Like, seriously, who does that? 

But the best part is when some genius decides to turn it into a meme and roast the OP for even posting it in the first place. It makes everyone stop and wonder, maybe this OP is actually for real? Nah, probably not.

Anyway, enough about that. Have any of you losers thought about getting a custom Xbox controller from the design lab? They'll put your pathetic gamer tag on it and even give it some fancy new camo design. And guess what? It's only $69.99. So go ahead, think about it, you absolute idiot. Don't be the loser at the slumber party without your sick personalized controller. Seriously, think about it. Here's the link if you're interested: [url].
------
Look, I really couldn't care less about what you eat or drink. It's not adding anything valuable to the discussion. We're both just making assumptions here, but at least I'm backing up my assumptions with articles. It's not like there's some law of nature that says beer has a health benefit. Scientists have been going back and forth on this for ages. But hey, let's take a moment to think about it. I've even found a link (<url>) that says beer might have some health benefits. Can you show me one scientist who thinks coke is good for you? I personally think it's a common misconception that alcohol, the addictive homewrecker, is somehow more dangerous than coke, the family-friendly choice that's consumed by everyone at events. But let's be real, according to modern health research, refined sugar is basically a useless substance that we all happily consume. And don't even get me started on all the crap additives in coke. Next time you see a can, read the damn label and see for yourself. So, if I'm missing something here, please enlighten me.
------
Dude, seriously? Who cares about some stupid ypc average? Yeah, it's not mind-blowing, but it's only been three freaking games! Give the guy a break. Look at the bigger picture, man. He's on the field more than last season, which means more opportunities to shine. And if he keeps up this pace, he's gonna rack up over 1350 scrimmage yards, 50 catches, and around 5 touchdowns. That's solid RB1 territory, my friend.

And hey, let's not forget that this dude doesn't have injury problems like Mixon or Fournette. So why the hell are you so concerned about his ranking? Give the guy a chance to prove himself, damn it! Stop overanalyzing every little detail and just enjoy the freaking game. Jeez.
------
Alright, listen up, folks. I don't know where you got the idea that I'm some sort of dictator or land grabber. I never said anything like that. In fact, I'm talking about using subsidies and incentives to get people on board with making some changes. You know, giving them a reason to switch things up voluntarily. It's not about forcing anyone, it's about enticing them with cold hard cash.

Let me break it down for you simpletons. People hold onto their farm or grazing land because it brings in money. But what if we made indoor farming so profitable that they couldn't resist? They'd be tripping over themselves to move on from traditional methods. And as for those cattle owners, they can find new gigs if they put their minds to it. We need to phase out meat production, for crying out loud. It's ruining our precious environment. Plus, let's face it, lab-grown meat is the future, and it'll be cheaper than the real deal soon enough.

So quit putting words in my mouth. I'm just here with some suggestions to save the damn planet, okay? No need for ultimatums, just some good ol' brainstorming.
------
Man, the fashion industry is such a freaking gamble, especially for those designers. Like seriously, who can predict what people are gonna go crazy for next? That's why these fast fashion places like express can sell their stuff so damn cheap. They just copy the successful high fashion crap, take out all the risk, and pump out mass quantities, which obviously brings down the price.

But let's talk about these big designer brands like Burberry. If they don't have enough stock of their hot items, they're basically screwing themselves out of making mad cash. And if they start producing less of everything, guess what? They gotta jack up the damn prices. And you know what that means? It's gonna turn off a bunch of potential customers and push them out of certain markets they might be banking on. So yeah, it's a freaking tough game to play, my friends.
------
Yo, what's up with all these self-promotion links, bro? Are you seriously trying to sell your book and advertise your Twitter fanbase on a subreddit? That's pretty low, man. Ain't nobody got time for that spammy nonsense here. And donating the proceeds to the ACLU? Yeah, right. Just some cheap PR move, I bet. Can't believe you actually expect people to fall for it. Get outta here with your shameless self-promotion. We're here to have real discussions, not be bombarded with your links. Keep this garbage to yourself, dude.
------
lmfao are you seriously asking for evidence on an internet forum? Go do your own damn research if you want hard evidence, lazy ass. And yeah, good luck trying to use an AR-15 or anything tactical in a court case, especially if you're in one of them liberal states. Those libtard judges will eat you alive, bro. Stick to your grandpa's Mossberg so you can at least look all old-fashioned and innocent. But hey, who needs evidence or logic when you can just spout off some bullshit, right? Keep living in your little fantasy world, buddy. Meanwhile, us real men will be out here using our tactical gear and having a good laugh at idiots like you. Peace out, snowflake. #AR15forlife
------
Okay, listen up ya'll. I gotta get something off my chest about this whole "14 year old online" situation. Yeah, it's messed up, I won't deny that. But c'mon people, the dude already did his time in jail and now he's stuck being a registered sex offender for life. Isn't that punishment enough? Seriously, we're wasting our hard-earned taxpayer dollars on keeping these ex-convicts down instead of actually rehabilitating them.

Look, I know it's a touchy subject, but let's face the facts here. Being sexually attracted to adolescents is just as much of a mental illness as your run-of-the-mill depression or suicidal thoughts. So why the hell are we still ignoring this issue? Instead of shunning these guys, maybe we should be focusing on helping them out, ya know? Give 'em a real shot at turning their lives around instead of constantly sending them back to the slammer.

I'm just sayin', it's time to stop sweeping this under the rug and start having some real discussions about it. We need to find a balance between punishment and rehabilitation, otherwise, we're just gonna keep repeating this cycle. Let's stop being ignorant and start making some damn progress.

Alright, let me break it down for you. You don't seem to get it, do you? There are only a handful of situations where you should be dishing out your unsolicited advice. To put it simply, if you're an expert or knowledgeable in a specific field and someone needs help, feel free to enlighten them. And hey, if they happen to be your friend and they're on the brink of ruining their life, maybe then you can pipe up.

Oh, and let's not forget about those rare instances when you actually have insight into their problem and you're in a close relationship with them. That's your golden ticket to give advice that they never asked for. Let's just say being a parent, guardian, teacher, instructor, boss, or even a religious figure also gives you a free pass.

But seriously, keep your opinions to yourself unless you fall into one of those categories. Nobody wants to hear your thoughts on someone's sexuality, weight, or how they choose to live their own damn life. It's simple, really. If they wanted your advice, they would have asked for it. So, save your precious words for someone who actually gives a damn.

Hey y'all! So apparently this astronaut dude, Scott Tingle, just got back from a 6-month trip to space. Can you believe it? Like, who even goes to space these days? Anyway, he did a bunch of experiments and stuff up there, and kept a journal about his adventures. He even made a list of the things he'll miss about being in space. Seriously, who would miss not showering for months and eating weird space food? 🙄

But here's the thing, starting on September 12th, you can ask him anything about adjusting back to our boring planet. Like, do you think he misses floating around and peeing into tubes? 😂 I mean, what else is there to talk about when it comes to being back on Earth, right? So if you're interested in his space poop stories or whatever, go ahead and shoot him some questions. I'm tapping out now, but thanks for the "fun" questions, guys!
------
Yeah, it's a total scam. These hospitals are just robbing us blind. They jack up the prices knowing that insurance companies will haggle them down, but if you don't have insurance, tough luck! You're stuck paying the ridiculously inflated price. It's messed up how they prioritize profits over people's well-being. And don't get me started on the whole "two businesses trying to reduce costs" crap. They're just trying to squeeze every last penny out of us while we suffer. This has been happening for ages, even before Obamacare came into the picture. It's like they're playing a sick game with our lives. Screw this messed up healthcare system.
------
Man, I just can't wrap my head around all this religious mumbo jumbo. Like seriously, if God is supposed to be this all-loving, all-powerful being, why the hell does he go around torturing people? And don't get me started on the whole sickness thing. If someone intentionally gave a baby a deadly illness, we would all say they're a sicko and should rot in jail. But when God does it, suddenly it's all part of his divine plan? Give me a break!

And let's talk about those poor babies being killed with swords. How can anyone defend that as anything other than torture? It's straight up monstrous! I don't care how wicked those people were or what false idols they worshiped, nothing justifies the brutal murder of innocent babies.

So go ahead, try to justify all this torture. But at the end of the day, God's actions speak for themselves. And they scream "I have no problem with torture, deal with it." It's messed up, plain and simple.

damn, you really think your precious PlayStation is so damn superior, huh? Well let me tell you something, buddy. Xbox is where it's at. Sure, PlayStation might have a few good exclusives, but that's about it. Xbox has way better features and a way better online experience. And don't even get me started on the free games every month on Xbox Game Pass. They actually give you quality games, not some crappy indie titles like PlayStation Plus. Plus, the installs are way faster on Xbox. No waiting around forever like you do on your precious PlayStation. And updates while you're away? Yeah, Xbox does that too. So don't come at me acting like PlayStation is the almighty console. It's really not. Xbox is where the real gamers are at.

Man, I gotta say, Fuji's instax line is all the rage these days. Apparently, they sold a whopping 7 million cameras in 2017! But here's the thing, most of those sales were for their mini line, which let's be real, is mostly for the kiddos who think it's a fun little toy. Don't get me wrong, I love shooting with their wide film because it's freaking amazing, plus it's way cheaper than polaroid film. But seriously, why are their cameras so damn bulky? And don't even get me started on the lack of manual features. It's like they don't care about us serious photographers who want more control. Come on, Fuji, step up your game!
------
Honestly, I couldn't give two shits about what the casual fans or non-crazy people think about the Trixie situation. Like, who cares if they mention it in conversation? It's not like their opinion matters anyway. And yeah, I'm sure it caused a stir with the normies outside of Reddit, because they can't handle the fact that their precious reality TV show isn't fair or whatever. But let's be real, if you're watching RuPaul's Drag Race as "just another reality competition", then you're missing the whole damn point. This show is iconic and deserves more respect than some lame-ass Big Brother or Love & Hip Hop crap. So yeah, the average viewer probably got pissed off like any other reality show and just moved on to the next garbage on TV. But us die-hard fans know that Drag Race is more than just a show, it's a fucking cultural phenomenon.

Honestly, if you're still rocking DDR3 RAM, it's definitely time to upgrade, my dude. Ryzen processors require DDR4, so you'll need a new motherboard and RAM. Don't forget that!

Now, for the CPU, I'd recommend going for the Ryzen 5 2600. It's a decent choice if you're gaming at 1080p or 1440p. But if you want some serious overclocking power and higher individual core performance, you might want to consider an overclocking Intel CPU, especially if gaming is your priority. Keep an eye out for the i7-9700k, which is gonna be soldered and will allow for some sick overclocks. And hey, if you're really getting into streaming, maybe even look into the i9-9900k.

Honestly, there's not much reason to go for the i5-8400 over the Ryzen 5 2600, unless you plan on upgrading to the best Coffee Lake processor in the future. The Ryzen 5 can match the i5's single core performance with a slight overclock, plus it has simultaneous multithreading for better multitasking and heavier workloads. So, yeah, think about your needs and make the right choice, my friend!

Are you seriously trying to argue that money doesn't matter when it comes to getting into elite colleges? Give me a break! Sure, technically they're non-profits, but let's not kid ourselves here. These places are all about the Benjamins. They may not have a "bottom line" per se, but they sure as hell care about their precious endowments. And you really think prestige is the only thing they bank on? Yeah right! They want those fat checks from rich alumni too.

And don't even get me started on admissions. It's all a damn game. They pretend to be all about merit and achievements, but we all know that money talks. If you have a billion dollars, you bet your ass you can buy your way into Harvard or any other top school. It might be harder nowadays because they try to keep up appearances with fancy acceptance rates and GPAs, but let's be real, it's still happening.

I'm not saying everyone at these schools is a trust fund baby, but let's not pretend like wealth doesn't play a role. So yeah, maybe you didn't meet any billionaires' kids, but that doesn't mean they're not out there, pulling strings and buying their way to success. Don't be naive.
------
Wait, hold up. Are you seriously trying to claim that parachutes were some kind of life-saving miracle during World War I? Dude, you've got it all wrong. Yeah, sure, maybe some people thought they were a good idea, but let me break it down for you. Parachutes actually doubled your chances of kicking the bucket. Can you believe that? You could only use them if you bailed out of your plane while it was straight and level, and even then, they were about as reliable as a toaster at a pool party. They were designed for those big, stationary balloons, not for planes on a frickin' crash course. So, yeah, good luck with that. And guess what? Only Germany had these so-called parachutes on planes, and surprise, surprise, they sucked at it too. Trust me, buddy, attempting a controlled crash was way less dangerous at the low speeds those biplanes flew at. It's not rocket science, okay? Keep those pilots alive. Period.
------
Yo, so let me tell you something about malls. I don't get why some people are acting like malls are dying when they're actually thriving in certain rich areas. Like, take LA for example. There are four cities - Arcadia, Cerritos, Torrance, and Glendale - with malls that are bigger than ever. And guess what? Three of those malls are mostly supported by well-off Asian Americans. It's like their second home or something. Then there's this one mall where all the folks from the east San Fernando Valley and northeast LA go to shop. It's poppin'!

But hey, I get it. If you're stuck in a white middle American suburb that got screwed over by the recession, you might think malls are dead. But listen, whenever I go back to my hometown, I always end up at the damn mall for something. So, don't be hatin' on malls just because they ain't doin' so hot in your area. The mall culture is alive and kickin', my friend!
------
I can't believe people on this subreddit are actually reminiscing about toxic voice channels and calling it nostalgic. Are you guys for real? Nostalgia is all about positive and happy memories from the past, not toxic and racist behavior. It's incredibly toxic to even think that way.

And don't get me started on the whole "people are too easily offended" argument. Sure, there are times when people overreact, but that doesn't justify disgusting behavior. It's never been acceptable or okay to be racist or toxic, and it's sad that some people miss those days.

If you're really craving that kind of toxicity, go find a group of like-minded individuals who enjoy spreading hate. I'm sure they're not too hard to find. But please, spare the rest of us who are trying to create a more inclusive and positive community.

Dude, seriously? Are you trying to claim that the Pixel 2 camera is like light years better than the iPhone XS camera? Based on a few freaking reviews? Give me a break. Personally, I would have picked the XS over the Pixel 2 any day, even without seeing the actual pictures taken. If I had to choose between a phone with a 100% killer camera but only 65% speed, and a phone with a 95% camera but 100% speed, I would go for option 2, no doubt. The Pixel 2 camera might have a slight edge in some areas, but it's not significantly better overall. From what I've read, the rest of the freaking phone is a total nightmare anyway. I mean, who cares what r/android thinks? I sure as hell don't. The truth is, these cameras are so damn close that you can't really say one stands out more than the other. So, for me, it's all about the freaking ecosystem. I have a sick DSLR and awesome lenses, bro. And guess what? I'm starting to use my phone more for general pics 'cause I don't feel like lugging my gear around all the damn time. And let me tell you, I highly doubt you can blow up pictures to 60"x40" with an iPhone or Pixel. But with my DSLR? Hell yeah, I get some sick enlarged shots, man.
------
Okay, seriously, what is the deal with all these people freaking out about things that might not even exist? I mean, take the Kavanaugh hearing for example. They're holding up the whole damn thing just because they're scared of some mysterious documents that may or may not exist. Like, come on! We've already looked through half a million documents and found nothing. And let's not forget he's been a judge for ages, with a clear track record and everything. Plus, some of the articles they used to defend Clinton were written by this guy! So why are they freaking out over this stupid "thing" that might or might not be there? Seriously, enough of this nonsense. Show me some actual proof that I can see, hear, touch, whatever. Otherwise, shut up and move on.
------
Yo, what's up fellow Redditors? Just stumbled upon this thread and I gotta say, I couldn't agree more with the OP. Like seriously, how can anyone not see that Trudeau is straight-up pandering to women? It's obvious as hell! Sure, some people might not see it that way, but for me, it's crystal clear. And don't even get me started on those pride parades. Ugh! Personally, I find them gross, even though I'm gay myself (no need to argue about that, please). And seeing politicians joining in? Wow, that's just pandering at its finest, my friends. I'm not saying Trudeau is better or worse than Trump, but damn, he knows how to pander and he does it like a pro. Anyway, just had to put my two cents in. Keep the discussion going, peeps!
------
Are you seriously that dense? It's clear you have no understanding of the point being made here. The fact that you bring up the #MeToo movement just shows how ignorant you are. 

And don't even get me started on your comment about the accused being crucified without evidence. Maybe you should educate yourself on the justice system before making such idiotic statements. Do you really think rape victims just make things up for fun and to ruin lives? Get a grip.

Your article was absolutely cherry picked, and it's clear you're too dense to realize it. There are countless cases where women have been dragged through the mud after reporting rape, but I guess that doesn't fit into your narrow-minded perspective. 

So, do us all a favor and pull your head out of your ass. It's embarrassing how willfully ignorant you are. Grow up and try to be a decent human being for once.
------
Okay, I don't get why everyone keeps going on about sensor size like it's the end-all-be-all. Like seriously, it's not magic or anything. Sure, if you want the same amount of light hitting a Micro Four Thirds (m43) sensor as a full-frame (ff) sensor, you gotta crank up the aperture by two whole stops. And yeah, that means the depth of field matches up, but big whoop.

I mean, what's the big deal with getting the same number of photons anyway? Does it really make a difference? Are people just obsessed with reducing shot noise or something? And don't even get me started on people saying ff improves low light performance. Does it actually? Or is it just because of the damn lenses that are available?

From what I can gather, the only real advantages of buying into larger sensors are better dynamic range (so harder to blow out highlights), easier lens sharpness, and the ability to achieve shallower depth of field. But seriously, is all that worth the extra cost and limited lens options? I have my doubts.
------
Yo dude, don't sweat it. I'm the same height as you and I've done just fine with the ladies. Had my fair share of relationships and one night stands. Sure, I've been rejected plenty of times too, but who hasn't?

You know what? Don't listen to those girls who claim they only want tall dudes. They don't know what they're missing out on until they meet someone like you. I've had girls tell me they love being with a guy who's their height. And when they're with a tall dude, they'll go on about how great it is to have a towering fella. It's all about the moment and how they feel, man.

But here's the thing, confidence is key. Being insecure is a bigger turn-off than being vertically challenged. Work on your social skills and go out more. Even if you got social anxiety, you can still make it happen.

Look, I'm not the most confident guy out there and I struggle with insecurity too. But you gotta push through it, bro! I'm also a skinny dude, so I know it'd be easier to score if I was ripped, and probably harder if I was a chunker. You just gotta work with what you got, and hey, at least we look good, am I right? And personality matters, man. You could be hilarious, cool, or downright charismatic. Own that shit!

Hope this helps, and no, I ain't high as a kite right now, haha!
------
Dude, you are so out of touch with reality it's not even funny. Your "evidence" is nothing but a bunch of baseless claims and stereotypes. Single parent households and feminism have absolutely nothing to do with someone being gay. Like seriously, do you even understand the concept of sexual orientation? It's not some lifestyle choice or a result of upbringing, it's just who people are.

And your little jab at "traditional family breakdown"? Give me a break! The world is evolving, and thankfully we're moving away from outdated gender roles and embracing diversity. So, stop trying to blame everything on homosexual people, it's pathetic and ignorant.

If you want to have a valid discussion, try actually educating yourself on the topic instead of regurgitating ridiculous nonsense. But until then, I suggest you keep your narrow-minded opinions to yourself.
------
Look, I get it. People here on Reddit can be real pessimistic assholes sometimes. But honestly, can we just chill the fuck out for a second? Just because a bunch of people are hating on a movie before it's even out, doesn't mean it's automatically gonna be a steaming pile of shit. I mean, come on, have you ever been pleasantly surprised by a movie that you thought was gonna suck? I know I have.

Sure, the odds might not be in its favor, but that doesn't mean we should all start declaring it a disaster before we've even seen it. Let's try to keep our expectations and judgments in check here, folks. It's one thing to be cautious and skeptical, but let's not go all doomsday on this shit.

And you know what? If people wanna come here and rant about their fears and frustrations, let 'em. Sometimes venting can be therapeutic. Just because you're tired of hearing it doesn't mean other people shouldn't be allowed to express their concerns. So let's all try to be a little more understanding, even if we think they're overreacting.
------
Man, let me tell you, that "hollywood" location in LA ain't all it's cracked up to be. Sure, it might seem cool and fancy with its trendy space and fancy donuts, but trust me, it's all style and no substance. And don't even get me started on the price! Overpriced is an understatement.

Listen, LA is the land of donuts, my friend. You can find way better creative donuts at these mom-n-pop joints that actually taste better, and they won't break your wallet. Why waste your time and money on this place?

Oh, and can we talk about the location? It's not even in Hollywood, for crying out loud! It's in Universal CityWalk, which is basically part of the damn theme park. So either you cough up 20 bucks to park in their fancy garage or you try your luck finding some street parking at the bottom of a freaking hill and hike your way up.

Save yourself the trouble, folks. There are way better options out there.
------
I totally feel you on this! It's so frustrating when I splurge on these fancy-ass palettes and end up only using a handful of shades. Like seriously, what a waste of money and space! But you know what? I've discovered the Natasha Denona minis and they are a game-changer. The shade selection is on point and the quality is out of this world! I mean, those huge pans?! Ain't nobody got time for that! The 5 pans are all I need and I actually use every single shade. And let's not even talk about how buttery and dreamy they are. Ah-mazing! Although I gotta say, the shades in the tropics palette weren't as bomb as I expected. But hey, different strokes for different folks, right? Anyway, I'm determined to declutter my stash and treat myself to the Lila palette at the next Sephora sale. Gotta have some motivation, you know?
------
Yo, so I heard they do something similar in Rust. Maybe you should hit up u/steveklabnik1 and ask him about it. From what I understand, when they need to do some "middleend" passes, they create this intermediate IR thingy called MIR that's tailored specifically for Rust. It's all about optimizing and stuff, especially when it comes to ownership in Rust. So basically, the Rust team can write a bunch of cool optimization passes that work on MIR because they know Rust inside out. Then they convert that MIR into LLVM IR and send it off to the LLVM backend. And you know what happens then? More passes! No wonder people complain about Rust's compile times. Anyway, after all those passes, LLVM spits out the most optimized code it can. Pretty dope, right?
------
Look, I get it. Sometimes food places can't list all their damn ingredients because they're too complex or they don't want to spill their precious secret recipes. Whatever, man. And yeah, maybe they change things up based on what's available or what the chef feels like that day. I guess that makes sense for those fancy pants chain restaurants.

But let's be real here, especially for those mom and pop shops, just ask them directly, okay? It's the only way you'll get an accurate answer. Who cares about some written information? Talk to the people making your food, bro!

And seriously, if you have some kind of serious allergy or you're deathly afraid of certain ingredients, don't leave it to chance. Trust, but verify, my friend. Don't take any risks if you're unsure. It's your life on the line, after all.
------
So, I was just browsing this subreddit and came across this crazy story about this dude with an epic door setup. Apparently, the cops tried to bust into his place, and they brought a whole squad with a battering ram. Can you believe that? They kept smacking the door like maniacs, but it just wouldn't budge. Meanwhile, this guy is snickering at them from inside, taunting them like a boss.

Then, things got even better. The cops start yelling and swearing, demanding that he opens the damn door. And you know what this legend says? He tells them to chill the hell out and stop trying to break the door down. He even had the guts to say that if they rang the bell like normal people, he would've let them in! Hilarious, right?

Well, turns out, this poor dude was set up by his ex who wanted revenge. She snitched on him for dealing drugs and having illegal firearms. Turns out, she's the real scumbag here. But guess what? They let him go moments later because the whole thing was a load of crap!

Honestly, I can't even imagine living in such a messed up neighborhood where you need all these insane security measures. But hey, that's life, right?
------
Oh, so now we're all legal experts on this subreddit too? How impressive. Look, I don't have time to dig into the boring details of some stupid expulsion policy. Who cares about the "need to maintain the effectiveness of the school's educational programs"? They just want to kick out the troublemakers, plain and simple. And honestly, they should! If these kids are causing such a fuss that it's affecting the safety and wellbeing of others, then bye-bye! It's not about balancing anything, it's about protecting the majority. So, stop acting like you're some wise sage with your fancy quotes and just admit that sometimes people deserve to get expelled.
------
Alright, listen up, folks. I've got a bone to pick with this theory. Yeah, there's all this talk about hidden meanings and twists, but let me tell you something - it ain't that deep. Seriously, there's been no twist in Jon's beliefs here, none at all. We've been through all the messed up stuff Ramsay has done, seen it firsthand through Theon's chapters, and we all want him dead, right? So you can imagine my frustration when he shows up at the Wall bleeding out and challenging Jon Snow.

But here's the thing, we all wanted Jon to break his vows and give Ramsay a taste of his own medicine. We wanted Jon to go full-on berserker mode. And guess what? George R.R. Martin flips the script on us. Instead of the epic showdown we were craving, we get mutiny. Mutiny, people! It's a whole new level of horror for us readers. It's like Martin is looking at us and saying, "So you thought Jon would go after Ramsay, huh? Well, think again."

Now, if Jon doesn't believe the damn letter is from Ramsay, and it's just some vague issue with him, then a lot of the emotional rollercoaster this chapter gave me goes down the drain. It's a cryptic twist that doesn't even come close to the raw journey we were on before the mystery popped up. Ugh, it's frustrating as hell. Can't we just get the showdown we wanted?
------
Man, I feel your pain. Dealing with social media algorithms is such a damn headache. It's like these platforms want to make it impossible for small businesses to get any visibility. And don't even get me started on the money pit that is promoted posts. It's a total scam, plain and simple.

I mean, I get it, they need to make their cash somehow, but the return on investment is just laughable. I remember telling my boss not to waste a single dime on that crap, but she wouldn't listen. We poured tons of money into Facebook and Instagram campaigns, thinking we'd get some decent exposure, and what did we get? Zilch. Nada. It was a big fat waste of time and money.

So yeah, if you're thinking about throwing your hard-earned cash at promoted posts, save yourself the trouble and run the other way. You're better off spending that money on some good ol' fashioned word-of-mouth advertising. Trust me on this one, dude.
------
Damn, can you believe how messed up our economy is? I mean, who the hell thought it was a good idea to base our currency on gold and silver in the first place? Like, seriously? We don't even use them directly anymore, but we're still feeling the consequences. Now we gotta print more damn money just to keep up, which ends up driving the prices of everything through the roof. And if that's not bad enough, our currency becomes worth more than other countries', making it harder for us to sell our stuff abroad. It's like a never-ending cycle of economic disaster.

I mean, come on! In this global economy, you'd think things would just fix themselves, right? But no, we keep messing with it and causing even bigger problems. It's like these people in power have no clue what they're doing. They need to stop tinkering around and address the real issues. Otherwise, we're all screwed, man. Money flowing out of the country, manufacturing going down the drain... it's a freaking mess. Somebody needs to get their act together and fix this broken system already.
------
Okay, seriously, what's the deal with the Supreme Court? Like, do they think they're some kind of exclusive club or something? I mean, come on, we're talking about a country with millions of people here. How are we supposed to squeeze everyone into that tiny courtroom? And don't even get me started on the fact that they won't let us watch the damn proceedings online. It's 2021, people! We have the technology to livestream everything from cute cat videos to random people eating cereal, but somehow we can't figure out how to stream the most important court cases in the country? It's just ridiculous. And don't even get me started on the justices themselves. They might as well wear their political biases on their sleeves, 'cause it's pretty damn obvious. We need more transparency and direct access if we're gonna have any faith in this so-called democracy of ours.
------
Man, let me tell you about the bullshit I had to go through during my English literature degree. So in my third year, we had this ridiculous final exam where they give you a quote from one of the books we had to read, and you gotta identify which book it's from, the context, and why it's important. Like, seriously? Just a test to make sure we actually did the damn reading. And guess what? I had read every single book on that list except for this one called Tod. I tried, alright? But that book was a freaking snooze fest.

So here's the kicker, the quote they give us is something like "the creature came across the field, walking on six legs." And you know what? That line was from the damn Tod book that I had just forced myself to read the day before the exam! Talk about luck! I nailed it, aced that exam, but man, that book was such a long and depressing read. Can't believe I wasted my time on that crap.
------
Well damn, it's about time someone said it. This whole "1.0" label for the game is a joke. Like seriously, who are they trying to fool? We all know this game is far from finished. So what's the deal here? Are they just trying to save face and make a quick buck? It sure feels like it.

And let's not even get started on the devs. I mean, come on, if they had their way, this game would never see the light of day. They're just following orders from their greedy bosses up top. So yeah, I guess we shouldn't be too surprised by this half-assed release.

But here's the thing, why do people keep defending it? Saying "oh, it'll get completed eventually" and all that crap. Seriously, how is that good enough? We paid our hard-earned money for a finished game, not some broken mess with missing features.

And don't even get me started on other games that pulled this crap. Planetside 2 and PUBG, what a joke. But hey, people still enjoyed them, right? So maybe we should just shut up and take what we can get.

But you know what? I'm tired of settling for mediocrity. I demand better, and I think we all should. So yeah, count me in for raising hell about this so-called "1.0" release.
------
What the hell is going on with Pokemon these days? Weren't they hyping up some fancy new Pokemon and now we only get 151? Like seriously, what a letdown. And don't even get me started on these core games coming out in 2019. Are they trying to milk us Pokemon Go players for every penny we've got? I mean, come on, the mobile game is still raking in millions every month. Can't they just give us more Pokemon and new areas already? But no, we're supposed to wait patiently for the "full experience" next year. And don't even mention Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. I'm so sick of these repetitive mainline titles every damn year. Give us some variety, Game Freak! Hopefully, next year we'll finally get the next gen and maybe a Johto spin-off after that. I bet they'll call it Pokemon Let's Go Pichu and Let's Go Togepi, just to mess with us even more. Ugh, I swear, sometimes being a Pokemon fan is so frustrating.
------
Hey, did you guys know that the government demands financial statements from every First Nation in Canada that gets funding? Yeah, every freaking year! And get this, the department in charge of monitoring it is totally underfunded. Surprise, surprise!

Now, listen up. After they passed the First Nation Fiscal Transparency Act, they found out that about 50 chiefs were involved in some level of corruption. But wait for it...only like a dozen of them were actually seriously corrupt. So, that means there are still around 550 other nations with no corrupt chiefs. Man, that's like a miracle or something, right?

And hey, if you don't believe me, go check out these third party audited financial statements from almost every First Nation in Canada that have been handed over to the government for decades. Boom! Evidence, baby!

Look, mismanagement is a massive problem on reserves, second only to mental health issues. And guess where those mental health problems come from? Residential schools, my friend. But hold your horses, I'm not saying I went to one or anything. It's just common sense. Imagine a whole town full of adults with PTSD raising messed up kids because they never had a decent role model. Now throw in abuse, alcoholism, and drug addiction. You really think those poor kids stand a chance in today's society?

I'll be real with you. I don't have a magical solution for the super remote reserves, especially outside of B.C. But let me tell you, my nation is rocking it. We've got doctors, mental health professionals, public works, sewage treatment, clean water, and accredited teachers all working on reserve full time. We've got a bunch of aboriginal employees too. And guess what? We're like six hours away from the nearest big city. That's how we do it!

So, there you have it. My two cents on the whole First Nation deal. Feel free to share your honest opinions, even if you don't agree with me. Peace out!

Alright, listen up. I see this question pop up a lot and it's honestly mind-boggling how people can't figure this out. So, let me break it down for you. If you wanna play with your sister on Xbox One from your precious PC, it's actually pretty simple, despite what all those official sources and YouTube videos might make you believe.

First things first, forget about searching in the game or menu for that elusive option. It doesn't exist. You won't find it anywhere. So, how do you do it? Well, you need to have one of two things: either Minecraft Realms or a fancy DIY server at home. Now, I know you're worried about spending money on Realms, but trust me, it's probably your best bet for cross-platforming. Yeah, yeah, I get it, you don't wanna waste your hard-earned cash. But hey, it's better than trying to navigate through all the confusing jargon and technicalities of setting up your own server.

So, to summarize, if you wanna play with your sis on Xbox from your PC, go for Minecraft Realms. Don't overthink it, just do it. Good luck and happy gaming!

Yeah, no shit, mass unemployment is gonna happen once those damn automated trucks start rollin' in. Like, duh! But hey, there might be some new jobs poppin' up eventually, but we gotta brace ourselves for the in-between, ya know? Some folks reckon we should set up a social safety net with basic income to handle the fallout, and honestly, it might actually save us some moolah in the long run. I mean, come on, the amount they give out ain't gonna make anyone live like a freakin' king. It just gives folks a little cushion and freedom to take risks, like workin' for startups without the fear of goin' broke. Plus, it might even give our economy a boost or somethin'. But hey, who knows for sure, right? We just gotta run an experiment and see what happens, that's it.
------
Look, I ain't no therapist or anything, but have you even tried getting off your lazy ass and doing something active? Like seriously, just force yourself to do it. I get it, you don't wanna do shit because you're all depressed and stuff, but maybe if you just follow a stupid schedule and go for a damn walk in the park every damn day, it might help. I mean, what else are you gonna do, sit around and mope all day? Give it a shot, it's not like you have anything better to do. I hope it works out for you, but who knows, maybe you're just a lost cause. Good luck, I guess.

Honestly, I don't get why people are praising this season so much. The animation director really dropped the ball here. The story might be decent, but the visuals are just plain dull and uninspiring. It feels like I'm watching some generic anime now, nothing like the vibrant and beautiful Attack on Titan that we all know and love. Remember that epic scene between Reiner and Eren on the bridge? That was powerful and memorable. But now, all we get is a weak reveal followed by some pathetic attempts at creating dramatic effects. It's honestly disappointing. Season one was way more exciting, especially the action scenes. Can't believe they've let it come to this.

So, I was doing some browsing and stumbled upon this whole Chernobyl thing. You know, that nuclear disaster that happened like forever ago? Anyway, there's a bunch of conflicting info out there, and it's making my head spin.

According to this AP report, these dudes named Alexei Ananenko, Valeri Bezpalov, and Boris Baranov were supposed to prevent a steam explosion during the disaster. They opened some sluice gates to drain a bubbler pool or whatever. Sounds pretty intense, right?

But here's where it gets confusing. Some sources claim that these three guys died just two weeks later from radiation poisoning. Like, seriously? That's a tough break. Shows like "Surviving Disaster - Chernobyl Nuclear" and that book "Catastrophe: A Guide to World's Worst Industrial Disasters" back up this story.

BUT, hold your horses. There's this other book called "Chernobyl 01:23:40: The Incredible True Story of the World's Worst Nuclear Disaster" that says these dudes didn't die from radiation. According to them, two of them are actually still kickin' today (although one did eventually bite the dust in 2005).

Now, I don't know who to believe anymore! But hey, at least I found this article on souzchernobyl.org that backs up the whole "they didn't die from radiation" theory. So, I guess we'll never really know the truth, huh? Just another day on the internet, folks.
------
LOL, are you seriously trying to deny the connection between Manafort and Trump? Are you living under a freaking rock or something? It's crystal clear that this evidence directly implicates Manafort's involvement with the Trump campaign and the alleged collusion with Russia. I mean, come on! The government's motion clearly states that two US businesses linked to Manafort never filed the required bank account reports for their foreign accounts. And let's not forget about Manafort's own motion to exclude any mention of his role in the Trump campaign and the Russia allegations. The fact that the government has only raised a limited objection to that motion speaks volumes. So, please, spare us the delusion and wake up to reality. This is some serious stuff, and it absolutely connects to Trump and his freaking campaign.
------
Yo, so let's talk about these boiling water reactors and their containment systems. The whole nitrogen thing, it's all about preventing explosions inside the containment. But guess what? Those explosions we saw weren't because of the containment itself, they were because those damn things were pushed way beyond their limits and overheated. Leaks happened, then boom, hydrogen exploded. So yeah, not the containment's fault.

And remember that Three Mile Island incident? They didn't need fancy passive hydrogen converters there. All they needed were some approved hydrogen control systems. For the older bwrs, they just had to inert the containment and make sure they could vent and purge it to avoid going over the detonation limit. Mark 3 bwrs and ice condenser pwr plants had to use hydrogen preigniters and recombiners, with limits on hydrogen generating stuff. But hey, those big dry pwr containments, no special limits! Just needed some vent and purge action, ain't no biggie.

But hold up, all this talk is only about the containment, man. No mention of hydrogen leaks from the containment. And after Fukushima, those foreign plants started making a fuss about passive hydrogen recombiners, but not everyone jumped on that train. Crazy, right?
------
Are you kidding me? Seriously, this is what we're talking about now? First off, let's clear one thing up: nobody should be getting banned from anything just because of their views. I mean, who decides what's right and wrong anyway? These tech companies think they can play god and silence anyone they disagree with. It's ridiculous! 

And don't even get me started on banks. So now we're saying that if you have a different opinion, you shouldn't be allowed to have a credit card? What's next? Are they gonna start cutting off water and electricity too? It's a slippery slope, my friends.

But hey, here's an idea. How about we go back to the good ol' days of common carriage? You know, the idea that companies can't refuse service to people just because they don't like them. Seems pretty simple to me. These tech giants need to stop being so biased and start treating everyone equally.

Oh, and by the way, what happens when this guy actually uncovers a real conspiracy? Like that messed up syphilis experiment the government did back in the day? Are all the people who repeated what he said gonna get punished too? Think about it.

Alright, rant over. Let's keep fighting for freedom of speech and equal treatment for all.
------
Um, excuse me? Are you seriously trying to argue that the mainstream media in America is right-wing-controlled? That's some next-level delusion right there. It's pretty clear to anyone with half a brain that the media is overwhelmingly biased towards the left. Just look at the demographic of journalists and reporters - they're all a bunch of left-leaning non-denominational Protestants. And don't even get me started on the so-called "moderators" on this subreddit. They're all leftists too! Yeah, sure, this board is totally moderate. Give me a break. It's just another echo chamber for socialist and communist nutjobs. But hey, keep living in your fantasy world if it makes you feel better.
------
Look, let's be real here. Just because you're not divorced doesn't automatically mean you're happily married. I mean, come on, how many marriages do you know that are actually worth envying? Most of them just end up being these lukewarm, mediocre things at best.

People stick together for all sorts of reasons, like having kids or being tied down by financial obligations. Or maybe they're just lazy and comfortable with the routine, so why bother going through a divorce? And let's not forget those folks who won't give up their fancy suburban house in a decent school district, even if it means staying in a loveless marriage.

Honestly, the more I see my friends go through this, the less convincing marriage seems to be. Sure, there are a few lucky ones who genuinely seem fulfilled in their relationships, but the rest? Yeah, they should probably start looking for someone else who can actually make them happy.
------
Yeah, increasing teacher salaries might help attract more talented people to the profession, but let's be real here: getting rid of tenure in secondary schools is where it's at. We gotta kick those burnt-out teachers to the curb and give the fresh blood a chance to shine. Screw the old farts who just want to hold on to their cushy jobs.

I mean, sure, teachers unions have their place, but sometimes they're too busy protecting the deadweight instead of looking out for the young guns who actually give a damn. It's like they're stuck in the past, man.

Honestly, I think the reason teachers aren't paid more is 'cause people can't measure the value they bring. Like, everyone's worried that paying them more won't magically make test scores shoot up. And don't even get me started on trying to link pay to test scores or other metrics. It's a never-ending controversy, dude.

Look, America's education system is mediocre compared to other developed countries. But it's not all about money. We can throw all the cash we want at schools, but if the students aren't receptive, it won't matter how awesome the teachers are.
------
I seriously don't get why people are so obsessed with privacy. Like, who cares if companies collect our data? It's not like they're using it for anything bad, right? Plus, I actually find it kinda convenient when they tailor ads to my interests. Saves me the trouble of having to search for stuff myself. And let's be honest, we all know that nothing online is truly private anyway. So why bother getting all upset about it? Just embrace the fact that we live in a surveillance society and move on with your life.

Oh, and while we're at it, can we please stop with the whole "trigger warning" thing? It's just a bunch of sensitive snowflakes looking for attention. If you can't handle a little discomfort or differing opinions, maybe the internet isn't the place for you. Grow a thicker skin already! It's ridiculous how everything has to be censored nowadays just to cater to a few easily offended individuals. It's called free speech, people. Look it up!
------
Man, I totally feel you on this one. Blizzard seriously messed up with these warfronts and island expeditions. It's like they just threw in some mindless grind fest and called it a day. I mean, come on! Give us something interesting like the brawler's guild or at least some cool scenarios.

I just did this stupid quest where I had to kill 15 freaking naga and collect their poop or something. And guess what? After turning it in, they hit me with the same crap two more times! What were they thinking? It's like they're trying to make us lose our minds.

And let's not forget about the stupid pathfinder crap we have to do just to unlock a couple of extra mythics. Seriously, who has time for that? And now, on top of everything, we have to grind our asses off for 7th legion rep. It's just painful, man.

And don't even get me started on my freaking 341 ilevel. It's like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of mediocrity. Blizzard better get their act together before they lose a ton of players.
------
Why do some jobs even bother asking why you're not at your previous one anymore? Like, why does it even matter? It's none of their damn business! And then they expect you to lie about it too. Seriously, who wants to hire someone who's been fired anyway? It's like going to a bank and telling them you just defaulted on your mortgage when you're trying to get a loan. Good luck with that! It's all about playing the game and knowing how to bullshit your way through the interview process. Don't be honest, just make your resume sound like the perfect fit for the job. It sucks, but that's just how it is in the real world.
------
Okay, so let's talk about this whole thing. At first, I thought this chick was just pulling a classic political move to take down Kavanaugh. I mean, come on, it seemed like she was riding the MeToo wave all the way. But now, things are starting to look a bit different.

Kavanaugh actually admitted knowing her and the other guy involved. And Ford had the guts to swear under oath. I gotta say, it's making me wonder if there's some truth to her story. Don't get me wrong, I'm not fully jumping ship on Kavanaugh just yet. This whole situation hasn't blown wide open, and I'm not giving up my support for someone accused of sexual assault unless there's solid proof.

But hey, I'm keeping an open mind. Things can change. So let's see where this crazy rollercoaster takes us. Just remember, innocent until proven guilty, right?
------
Seriously, what even is this post? Are you trying to preach or something? I don't need your condescending advice on trust and gods. Trusting without reasoning is called faith, in case you didn't know. And yeah, newsflash, people with empathy exist and they don't need a god to understand pain and trouble. Life not being forever is a basic fact, no need for an imaginary man in the sky to tell me that. And don't even get me started on your whole spiel about older people and authority figures. What does that have to do with anything? And why do gods need us to practice trust? Like seriously, are you even making any sense here? Oh, and to answer your last question, no, I'm not Christian, and I'm definitely not buying what you're selling.
------
Man, let me tell you something about Les Miles. In his 11 years at LSU, when the SEC West was stacked with some of the best teams in college football history, he never did worse than 8-5. I mean, come on! Saban was at Bama, Petrino was at Arkansas, Freeze was at Ole Miss, and don't even get me started on Auburn with Cam Newton and Gus Malzahn. And let's not forget Mullen and Dak Prescott at Mississippi State.

Not to mention, he had to deal with Florida and Urban freaking Meyer, and they had Tim Tebow running all over the place. Plus, he played tough out-of-conference games against Oregon, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and TCU. And guess what? He still managed to have a top 5 recruiting class and only come in third in the conference. Third! The man was playing against teams every year that had top 10 recruiting classes. 

So yeah, say what you want about Les Miles, but he was one hell of a coach. He had LSU in a position to win every single game he coached, without fail. That's some damn good coaching right there.
------
Alright, listen up, people. I just had to school this clueless idiot in the comments who clearly has no idea what they're talking about. They had the audacity to say that this issue is a non-issue because it doesn't compare to crimes in the west. Seriously? Are you kidding me? They even had the nerve to bring up the population size as if that somehow proves their point.

Well, newsflash genius, this problem isn't something you can just brush off with your fancy math and statistics. It's about empathy and understanding human suffering. So, I took it upon myself to educate this person with some hard-hitting stats and real-life examples. Let me tell you, it blew their mind. Suddenly, their precious math didn't hold up when faced with the harsh reality and all the extra factors involved.

I mean, seriously, how dense can you be? You can't just dismiss something because it doesn't fit into your narrow view of the world. So, yeah, I put that know-it-all in their place, and I hope they think twice before spouting nonsense again. Rant over.
------
Ugh, I totally get what you're saying. Like, it seems all these writers just can't stick to one freakin' storyline. First off, Claremont didn't mean for Joseph Danvers to be abusive, like come on! If he did, why would Carol still be friendly with him? And don't even get me started on Reed's retconning crap. So now he's an alcoholic? Big surprise. They always gotta tie these characters together somehow.

But let's talk about Stohl. Seriously, what the hell was she thinking? The way she portrayed Joseph in that comic was messed up. Beating the crap out of his kids? That's straight-up abusive. And then they go and do the same thing with Steve's dad too, making him an alcoholic AND abusive. Like, what's with all the daddy issues?

And yeah, sure, Carol has her own history of violence, but it's not like she's constantly throwing people through walls. It just feels like they're adding drama for the sake of it. And don't even get me started on the continuity issues. Writers these days just don't give a damn. Joseph Jr. being older than Carol? Like, seriously? Can't they get their facts straight?

I dunno, man. Sometimes it feels like these writers just don't know what the hell they're doing. It's frustrating as hell as a fan.
------
I mean, seriously, why are people making such a big deal out of this whole Sig vs Glock thing? It's not rocket science. The damn guns just had to meet some minimum stoppage rate, and both Sig and Glock passed that. End of story. But oh no, apparently Sig scored higher in the stupid "ergonomics" category and was able to provide more support and shit. And it was even 100 million dollars cheaper! Like, how can you argue with that? And let's not forget that Sig went above and beyond by submitting two guns instead of just one like Glock. They even put 500 rounds through the second one to prove it's as good as the main one. So what's the problem here? I'll tell you what, people just love to hate on anything that's different. It's all just a bunch of whiny crybabies if you ask me. Sig won fair and square, deal with it.
------
Okay, let's break this down. First of all, who the hell cares about semantics? We're not here to play word games, we're here to have a damn discussion. So don't waste my time with your "justification" bullshit, it's just a fancy way of saying you had a lame excuse for doing something. 

And while we're at it, let me tell you something. The end NEVER justifies the means. It doesn't matter how you twist it, doing something fucked up to get what you want is never reasonable. It's called being a shady asshole. 

But hey, some people like to think they're so clever and say that the means to an end are always the most reasonable. Well, let me burst your bubble, sunshine. That's just a load of crap. It's a weak attempt to make yourself feel better about doing crappy things.

So here's the bottom line: absolutes suck. Whether you think the ends are morally right or not, using twisted means to get there is just plain wrong. So stop trying to justify your shady behavior and start being a decent human being. That's all I've got to say.
------
Alright, listen up people. I've been saying this for ages, but it seems like nobody wants to listen. Diablo as an MMO? Hell yeah, it could be freakin' awesome! I mean, sure, we'd have to sacrifice that hack and slash feel that we all love, but think about it. Remember when we were kids and played Diablo for the first time? Those epic cutscenes, the immersive story? That sh*t was so much fun!

And don't even get me started on Diablo 2. It picked up right where the first one left off, and I was lost in that damn story. We were chasing our former hero who got corrupted by a damn soul stone he shoved in his forehead. How badass is that?

Then Lord of Destruction came out and I swear, I was a zombie sitting in my dark room, playing till the damn sun came up. But then WoW happened and it devoured 8 freakin' years of my life. But seriously guys, imagine the Diablo lore in an MMO. It would be wicked as hell!

Okay, rant over. Who else wants to live in a Diablo MMO? Let's make this sh*t happen!
------
Wow, it's incredible how misinformed you are. Can't believe someone actually believes this nonsense. Just because you read some conspiracy theory on the internet doesn't mean it's true. Crack is not just "fucking coke," it's a different form that has stronger effects and higher addiction potential. And don't get me started on your ignorant hash explanation. It's obvious you don't know what you're talking about. Hash is not just THC without plant material, it's a concentrated form of cannabis resin that can contain various cannabinoids. Maybe you should educate yourself before spewing such garbage. But hey, who am I kidding? You're probably too dense to understand facts anyway.
------
Alright, so here's the deal. I don't get why people make such a big fuss about joining tours. Seriously, it's not that hard to figure things out on your own. I mean, I'm Australian and my sister and I rented a car to drive around Edinburgh and London. Yeah, it was a bit of a hassle but at least we had the freedom to go wherever the heck we wanted.

And guess what? It's been two freaking years since we went to Stonehenge and I still miss the UK. Those were good times, man. Anyway, back to the point. If you're in London and lazy as hell, sure, join a tour. But just know that there are other options out there if you actually want to do some exploring on your own. So, yeah, that's my two cents. Take it or leave it, I don't really give a damn.
------
So I was just wondering about this whole environmental thing with trees, you know? And I quickly searched it up on Google because I'm a frickin' genius like that.

Apparently, real trees have some good stuff going for them. They absorb carbon and stuff while growing, which is great for the environment. Plus, they're renewable and all that jazz.

But let's get real here, there are downsides too. Cutting down and transporting those suckers takes energy and effort. Like seriously, have you ever seen your dad struggling to hack away at a tree in one of those "u pick" farms? It's a freakin' snoozefest.

Now, artificial trees are a different story. They're basically just fancy plastic crap. But get this, they say you only need to use one for like 4 to 10 years to make it worth it compared to chopping down a real tree (that is if you don't burn the damn thing).

So yeah, screw the real trees! Artificial trees all the way, my dudes. And if I really want that "tree smell," I'll just grab a can of something that smells like it. Easy peasy.
------
Man, TSM's coaching staff is absolute trash. I mean, have you seen what they've done to all the great junglers that go there? Sven, Santorin, Amazing... they all got mentally destroyed. It's like they suck the talent right out of these guys. Sure, Sven found some confidence again, good for him. But Santorin straight up carried FlyQuest this split, and Amazing is the reason Schalke even got second place. And don't even get me started on Bjergsen and his damn assassins getting banned out at Worlds. TSM might have a chance if they don't screw him over with their terrible coaching decisions. But honestly, I wouldn't hold my breath. TSM needs a serious overhaul if they want to be competitive on the world stage.
------
Hey guys, just wanted to share a little story with y'all. So, I was minding my own business, browsing the interwebs when I stumbled upon this sick sale. They were offering some specialty tools for a fraction of the original price - score!

Now, let me break it down for you. These bad boys usually cost over 1K, but thanks to my awesome bargain hunting skills, I snagged them for a mere 400 bucks. That's like saving 600 smackers right there!

But here's the thing, I didn't buy them just because they were on sale, alright? Nah, my old tools broke down and I legit needed replacements. So, even if they weren't discounted, I would've coughed up that grand anyway. So, technically, I'm up 600 bucks! Cha-ching!

Sorry for the lack of detail, folks. I'm too lazy to remember the name of the tools right now. Guess it's bedtime for me. Keep on hunting those deals, my fellow shoppers!
------
Man, this whole philosophical debate about ownership and morality is giving me a headache. Like, who cares if we own our bodies or not? It's not like we can just go around doing whatever the hell we want with them anyway. We live in a society with rules and stuff, so we gotta follow them.

And seriously, comparing owning your body to owning a TV or throwing a knife? That's some messed up logic right there. I mean, come on, there's a big difference between controlling your body and controlling a flipping television set.

And don't even get me started on the whole demonic possession thing. What does that have to do with anything? We're talking about real life here, not some cheesy horror movie.

Anyways, all this deep thinking is making my brain hurt. I'm gonna go find some funny cat videos to distract myself from this nonsense. Peace out, y'all!
------
Man, I can't believe how unfair job offers can be sometimes. I mean, come on, 15 cents above minimum wage? Are they kidding me? I was hoping for at least 60 cents more, but they didn't even bother considering it. And then they have the audacity to tell me it's the best they could do? Like, seriously?

But here's the kicker. They end up hiring some inexperienced 20-year-old kid who doesn't bring anything special to the table. Meanwhile, I know I would have rocked that job and brought a ton of value. And guess what? That little punk gets offered a promotion in another department right when things are getting crazy busy, and they can't find anyone to replace him. So what do they do? They offer him exactly what he was gonna make in the other department! A massive raise!

I had already moved on by then, but man, it felt so good to hear about it. Finally, some karma hitting them in the face. Serves them right for treating me like crap.
------
"LOL, are you for real? Do you even know what you're talking about? Social security is NOT welfare, dude. It's a safety net for hardworking folks who paid into it their whole damn lives. Calling it welfare is just plain ignorant. And yeah, of course politicians want to sugarcoat it and avoid offending people. That's how politics works, duh. But that doesn't change the fact that social security is a totally different thing. It's not some handout to lazy bums. It's a system where everyone chips in and then gets a bit back when they need it. And sure, Congress can make changes to the program, but that's because they gotta adapt to the times, not because they wanna screw people over. So please, get your facts straight before spreading nonsense."
------
Look, I get it, you're trying to give advice and all that crap. But seriously, did you even read the original post? They know about using a monitor, genius. And yeah, we all know you can use a controller, but who actually does that for FPS games? Keyboard and mouse, dude. Get with the program. 

And don't act like you're some expert who knows it all. Because guess what? Most people who have gaming rigs don't follow all the stupid methods you listed. Yeah, I said most. Maybe you should try to comprehend what you read instead of just coming up with some half-assed argument. 

Oh, and don't even get me started on the cost. Unless you're rocking some crappy rig, you're gonna be dropping a pretty penny. So maybe think before you start spouting off like you know everything. Jeez.
------
Can't believe I stumbled upon this post. Seriously, what's with all the hate? I don't get why people are so obsessed with having these insanely expensive speakers when the HomePod does the job just fine. I mean, who has the time or the patience to sit in one spot just to enjoy "proper" stereo? Not me, that's for damn sure.

I've got a bunch of fancy-schmancy speakers, and yeah they sound great and all, but the convenience of the HomePod is unmatched. Plus, it's not like my ears have some magical ability to tell the difference between every little nuance in the sound. For <cur>349, these bad boys do the trick, and they make my mornings way more enjoyable while I'm getting ready or just chilling around the house.

So all you audiophiles can keep your elitist attitudes to yourselves. The HomePod is where it's at, whether you like it or not. Peace out.
------
Man, this is some messed up situation you got yourself into. I can't believe these religious nutjobs are giving you such a hard time just because you don't believe in their imaginary friend. Like, who the hell cares what you believe or who you love? It's none of their damn business. And the fact that they're so judgmental and critical of minorities and the LGBTQ+ community just makes me sick.

Honestly, I don't know how you've been able to put up with this crap for so long. I would've lost my mind by now. But I get it, finding another job ain't easy, especially in a small town like that. It's like there's no escape from the ignorance and bigotry.

My advice to you is to just keep your head down and play along until you find something better. It sucks, I know, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do to survive. And hey, maybe one day you'll find a boss who actually respects you for who you are. Until then, hang in there and remember that you're not alone. We're here for you, even if those idiots at work aren't.
------
Damn, y'all really need to brush up on your math before you start spewing bullshit. I mean, seriously? 127 degrees Celsius? Are you trying to boil the damn drink or what? And don't even get me started on that radiation cooling rate crap. Who the hell cares about the precise numbers anyway? Just use some common sense, man.

A more reasonable temperature would be around 77 degrees Celsius which gives a net heat radiation of 400 watts per square meter. And guess what? That translates to a measly 20 degrees per hour. Yeah, it might still be faster than your brain can comprehend, but it ain't no exponential slowing of cooling rate or some fancy shit like that.

So please, spare us all the complicated algebra and just give it to us straight. Ain't nobody got time for this nonsense.
------
Man, I gotta vent about the current gen xf. Can't even begin to express my disappointment. I used to own an xfr and was pumped for the new xf, but damn, what a letdown.

First of all, it looks like they took all the excitement out of the design. The old model had some charm, but this one? Bland as hell. And you know what's worse? It drives and feels just as bland. What happened to the exhilaration that Jaguars used to deliver?

And let's talk about the engine options, or lack thereof. Seriously, did they just forget to give us any good choices? It's like they expect us to settle for mediocrity. Same goes for the interior and exterior upgrades - none of them are worth mentioning. They might as well have slapped a cheap price tag on it and called it a day.

Honestly, this car feels like it belongs in the bargain bin. I can't find a single positive thing to say about it. It's just plain awful. You know what's the saddest part? Even the f-type, which I thought would at least have some resemblance to Jaguar's glory days, shares more with it than the xf does. The only saving grace is the xj, the only one that still has that true Jaguar essence.

Oh, and don't even get me started on the new e-pace. It's like they're hitting rock bottom with each new release. Ugh!

I gotta say, it's ridiculous how conservatives claim to love liberty and small government, but then turn around and try to control women's bodies. Like seriously, forcing women to have babies? That's messed up.

And don't even get me started on the way they treat the poor. Letting people freeze or starve because they can't afford basic necessities? How heartless can you be?

But what really gets me is how conservatives think it's okay for people to work their asses off in jobs that pay peanuts. They literally expect them to just keep grinding away without being able to afford anything besides work. It's insane.

Oh, and let's not forget about the war on drugs. Putting millions of Americans in prison just for smoking a little weed? Come on, give me a break.

Honestly, it all comes down to fear. Conservatives are so scared of anything that challenges their narrow-minded views that they reject compassion and empathy. They think showing kindness is a sign of weakness. Well, I'd rather be a "liberal pansy" any day than a heartless coward.

And don't even get me started on religion. It's all about fear there too. Those who can't think for themselves just blindly follow, while those who question the lies have the courage to be agnostic.

So yeah, conservatives are basically a bunch of brainwashed cowards. Unfortunately, they make up about half of our society. It's a sad state of affairs, my friends.

So, get this guys, you won't believe what happened to me in this flat we moved into. So the gas and electric bills were originally in the name of the stupid letting agents. We called them up and got it transferred to us, but guess what? Those morons couldn't find any record of the electric bill! Can you believe that?

Anyways, life went on and we had been living there for a whole freaking year when one fine day, bam, we lost electricity. And get this, the pie and mash shop across the alleyway from us also lost power. What are the odds, right?

So, this maintenance guy comes to check it out and turns out, it wasn't our fault. It was that dumb pie and mash shop's problem. And guess what we found out? Those idiots were unintentionally paying our electric bill! Can you believe the luck?

So, yeah, we kept our mouths shut and lived there for another year with free freaking electricity, man! Our awesome maintenance guy told us to keep it secret, so we did. I mean, wouldn't you? Who would say no to free electricity, right?

Wow, what a bunch of hypocritical snowflakes we have in this subreddit. Seriously, you guys call yourselves libertarians, but all I see is a bunch of conservative sheep with your heads up your asses. You claim to champion transparency and the leaking of government information, but as soon as it's something that goes against your precious conservatives, suddenly it's a problem. Talk about selective outrage.

And don't even get me started on your so-called principles. It's laughable how quickly you would jump on the bandwagon if it was one of your own who leaked this information. But no, because it's a Democrat politician, suddenly it's the end of the world. Get over yourselves.

You guys are nothing but single-issue voters who will blindly support anyone with an R next to their name. I bet if Rand himself had leaked this, you'd be worshipping him like the king of libertariastan. So go ahead, keep pretending like you have any integrity or consistency. It's just another day in the life of a hypocritical conservative masquerading as a libertarian.

Yo, listen up! Gotta tell you straight, large skin burns are no joke. They're frickin' dangerous, man! The main risk is gettin' infected, and that's a big deal. Sure, some people survive it, but it takes some serious ass wound management and keepin' those pesky bacteria away. See, our skin usually keeps those little buggers at bay, but when you don't have that protective layer anymore, any harmless bacteria or organism can turn deadly.

Now, to answer your question from earlier, in normal everyday life, we want that ecosystem on our skin to keep the bad stuff out. But when you go through some traumatic shit like a massive burn, we gotta go all out with aggressive antibiotics to kill every single living thing. We just hope and pray that the aftermath ain't too damn terrible. So, take care of your skin, bro, and stay clean to avoid any nasty infections. Peace!
------
Wow, you really seem to have a lot of opinions without any evidence to back them up. Let me break it down for you.

First of all, do you even know what philosophy is? It's not just about throwing around some fancy terms and calling it a day. You need to actually make an argument for why objectivism counts as a philosophy. And please, don't cite Wikipedia like it's some kind of holy grail. That doesn't make it valid.

And speaking of citations, where are your facts about Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War? You claim that anarcho-syndicalism brought amazing results and prosperity, but where's the proof? Give us some actual statistics about growth, production, wealth, agriculture, and whatever else you mentioned. Otherwise, it just sounds like some made-up fairytale.

But hey, let's say for a second that it did actually happen. Do you honestly think it would have lasted? These wide-eyed eggheads always fail to see the reality of human behavior. There will always be power-hungry opportunists ready to take over and turn everything into a tyranny. That's just the way things work, buddy.

And finally, if you're gonna throw shade at capitalism, at least have the decency to back it up with some examples. Saying you don't approve of authoritarianism or unjustified hierarchy is easy, but where's the evidence that capitalism perpetuates that? Show me some concrete instances, or else your argument holds no weight.

So yeah, maybe spend a little less time spouting off baseless opinions and a little more time doing some actual research. Just a thought.

The AR-15, on the other hand, is just perfect for those who want to compensate for something. I mean, seriously, what's with all the hype? It's just a glorified semi-automatic rifle that makes people feel tough. Yeah, it might be customizable and accurate, but so what? It's not like you're going to war or anything. And don't get me started on the magazine capacity debate. Who needs all those rounds anyway? Unless you plan on shooting up a whole town, I don't see the point. But hey, if it makes you feel manly to own one, go ahead. Just don't expect me to be impressed. 

And while we're at it, can we talk about those gun enthusiasts who think they're some kind of experts because they watch a bunch of YouTube videos? It's hilarious how they act like they know everything about firearms when they've never even held a real gun. But hey, keep living that fantasy life, bro. Meanwhile, I'll stick to enjoying my video games and memes.
------
Yo, gotta say, I totally feel you on this one. Life back in the day must have been wild, no pun intended. None of this cubicle-slave, nine-to-five nonsense. Just imagine, hunting mammoths, chilling with nature, getting your hands dirty. Beats sitting at a desk staring at a screen all day, amirite?

And let's not forget about that primitive technology guy on YouTube. Dude's got millions of peeps watching him do all those boring survival tasks. Sure, it's sped up, but how many jobs these days would be entertaining even on fast forward? Not many, I can tell ya.

But yo, living in the wild ain't all fun and games. No community, no conveniences. It's like a one-man show out there. We need our people, man. And I get it, civilization has its perks. Fancy goals, ladder climbing, all that jazz. But honestly, how many of us are actually doing anything about it? We're just stuck on our couches, watching others achieve their dreams. Sad, really.

And let's not forget about contemplating the stars. Cavemen were probably more connected to the cosmos than we are. I mean, who dreams about space travel more, a caveman or your average Joe today? I'd put my money on the caveman any day.

So yeah, surviving might seem pointless and banal, but at least it's real, man. It's being in sync with nature and feeling a part of something bigger. Can't say the same for whatever folks these days consider their "meaning of life".
------
Look, I get it. You wanna play detective and act all high and mighty with your "modal narrative" crap. But let's be real here, this ain't no court of law. It's just a freakin' job screening for the high court. And yeah, we don't have perfect information, but do we really need it? Can't we just use some common sense?

You talk about proof beyond a reasonable doubt and all that fancy lawyer talk. Well, guess what? We're not lawyers, and we don't need to be. We're just regular people trying to figure out if Kavanaugh is the right guy for the job. And if there's even a chance these women are lying, then we gotta consider it. False allegations happen, dude. It's not some crazy conspiracy theory.

So yeah, I ain't buying your whole "I need more evidence" shtick. Show me something concrete, not just your fancy words. Because from where I'm standing, it looks like you just wanna protect Kavanaugh at all costs. And that, my friend, is some shady-ass bias right there.
------
Dude, are you serious right now? Your argument is weak AF. Just because the Bible says fornication is wrong, doesn't mean it only refers to sex outside of marriage. It's called interpretation, and people have been doing it for centuries. Plus, who cares if some so-called "experts" translated the Bible? They could have totally messed it up, for all we know. And don't even get me started on your claim that there are no academic writings on this topic. Maybe you should do some actual research before spouting off nonsense. Look, I get it if you have your beliefs, but don't act like they're unquestionable truths. Open your mind a little, man.
------
Dude, seriously, who cares if police officers are supposedly "good enough" multitaskers or not? I mean, come on, it's like you're defending them or something. Let's be real here, without that computer, they're probably just gonna be even more useless out there. Like, imagine how much more time it's gonna take for them to do anything without all that fancy technology. And don't even get me started on how safe the roads and areas are gonna be without those multitasking cops. It's gonna be a freakin' disaster, man.

But hey, you know what? I guess we should look at the other side too. I mean, it's not like multitasking is the devil or something, right? We should totally consider the risks and all that. But seriously, can't we just find a way to make it work instead of removing it completely? I mean, c'mon, let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater, you know? Anyways, that's just my two cents.

Yo, hold up! It's bullcrap to say that TSM didn't screw over junglers. The problem with those losers is that they never stick together as a freakin' team. Even back in 2016, they couldn't commit to anything, making the support and jungler look like garbage. I mean, sure, maybe that's their game plan, but most fans only care about KDA and start a dang witch hunt when things go south. So the players end up playing it safe, scared to make any moves because they don't know if their team has their back this time. And don't get me started on Mithy! Yeah, he made some mistakes in his G2 days, but he always made up for it with sick engages and smart plays. But in NA, everybody just focuses on his mess-ups and tells him what he should or shouldn't do. It's no wonder all the junglers on TSM either get tilted or GTFO after a year. The pressure there is insane. And don't even get me started on those TSM fans. They think they're all high and mighty with their "competitive team culture," but really, they're just a bunch of thin-skinned idiots who can't handle criticism. And honestly, not just TSM fans, but all NA fans are a bunch of shit too. TSM fans are just the loudest bunch, or maybe they're just anti-fans now. Screw all y'all!

samsung experience 9 is on a whole different level compared to pie. All you fanboys who cry about the features Samsung adds are the same ones who cream your pants when Google finally decides to catch up months or even a year later. And don't even get me started on the whole "behind on updates" crap. My s8+ is only about a month behind on security updates, and it's already on par with pie. So much for your precious "bloat." At least when I go full-on Apple fanboy, there's some validity to it. The newest iPhone always feels more polished and complete. But you pixel fanboys? Holy hell, paying more for less and then going around shitposting about it everywhere. Get a grip!

Man, I gotta say, upgrading to a reverse osmosis system and a water softener was the best damn decision we ever made. Our water used to be so friggin' hard it could practically break your teeth. But now, we've got that sweet, filtered H2O on tap. And get this, we even connected it to the freezer to make ice! I mean, who needs to buy those crappy plastic cups or paper plates when you've got your off-brand Yeti knockoff to hold that tasty, purified water? The only downside is having to replace those damn RO filters once a year, but hey, it's a small price to pay for the best-tasting water in town. Trust me, folks, this investment is totally worth it. Cheers to good water!
------
Seriously, people need to wake up and realize that not all educational systems are created equal. I mean, I went through a system that actually gave a damn about teaching us how to think critically. Can you believe it? We had a whole year-long philosophy class where we had to read freaking Plato! And guess what? You couldn't even graduate high school without passing that class. Now that's some real education.

But I guess not everyone is as lucky as me. Some places have these underfunded, dumbed-down systems where all they care about is rote memorization. Like seriously, who needs critical thinking skills anyway? Just give them a multiple-choice test and call it a day. And don't even get me started on the shallow assessments they use to measure success. It's like they're more interested in producing mindless drones than well-rounded individuals.

So yeah, not all educational systems are created equal. Some actually give a damn about their students' intellectual growth, while others just churn out mind-numbed zombies. It's a sad reality, but we can't ignore it.
------
Man, I totally get what you're saying. It's like everyone expects us to be all rainbows and sunshine, but sometimes life just sucks, you know? Like, why should we have to pretend we're happy when we're not? And the way people judge you for not enjoying life, it's so messed up. Like, mind your own business, Karen!

And I feel you on the whole afterlife thing. I mean, who knows what happens when we kick the bucket? Maybe it's just nothingness, maybe it's something better. But honestly, if there's a chance it's better than this crap, I'd take my chances. No offense to the good stuff in life, but sometimes it just ain't enough to make up for all the bullshit.

So yeah, screw anyone who tries to tell you how you should feel about life. It's your life, your choice. And if death seems more appealing, well, that's your call. You do you, man.

yo what's up everyone, just thought I'd share my thoughts on all the heroes in Dota 2. Now, I'm not an expert or anything, just a casual player, so take it with a grain of salt. Some of these heroes are easy to come up with a song for, like Abaddon, Alchemist, and Anti-Mage. But man, some of them are tough! I mean, how do you come up with a song for Bane or Beastmaster? Maybe I'll figure it out eventually. Oh, and Crystal Maiden, yeah I know "Let It Go" is an obvious choice, but I wanted to be different, you know? Anyways, here's my list so far. Let me know if you have any suggestions or if you think I should change anything. Peace!

By the way, I didn't include the links because I'm too lazy to find them. But you can google it yourself if you're interested. Just saying.

Hey, so there's this Q dude who claims to be some high-level military insider. Supposedly, this guy has been spouting off about a secret deep state conspiracy for years now. Can you believe that? Anyways, he's basically saying that all the governments around the world are corrupt as hell and working against us regular folks. And get this, he says he works with or for the freaking POTUS and military intelligence. Like, seriously? I can't even with this nonsense.

But if you're into this kind of stuff, you should check out those so-called "Q drops" this dude has been making. You can find them at qanon.app, qmap.pub, or qanon.pub. I mean, I just skimmed this crap, so don't come at me with any questions. But hey, if you're into conspiracy theories and want to waste your time on this wild ride, knock yourself out. Just don't say I didn't warn you about the craziness. Good luck, bro!
------
Seriously, what's the whole point of this post? Are you trying to argue that owing money is actually a great economic decision? Get real! Sure, maybe if you're Mark freaking Zuckerberg and you can get a sweet-ass mortgage at 1%, it makes sense to borrow money and invest it. But for the average Joe? Nah, bro.

And don't even get me started on the US deficit. You think the government should just keep spending money and not worry about paying it back? That's a load of BS. Eventually, someone's gotta pay the piper. And guess who that someone is? Yeah, us taxpayers.

Oh, and nice little tidbit about how the US debt is mostly owned by its own citizens. So what? We're still drowning in debt, whether it's owed to our own people or not. And don't give me that crap about other countries having debt too. Just because everyone else is doing it doesn't mean it's a good idea!

Bottom line: owing money sucks, no matter how you spin it. So let's stop pretending like it's some genius economic move and start focusing on getting our financial house in order.

Look, I hate to break it to you, but your understanding of consent is seriously messed up. It's not rocket science, buddy. If someone says "no," you freaking stop. End of story. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. It's really not that hard to comprehend, yet here we are, still having to explain it like we're talking to a bunch of Neanderthals.

And to the idiots out there who think teaching consent is unnecessary, wake the hell up! Clearly, we're still dealing with a bunch of morons who can't wrap their tiny little brains around such a simple concept. So yeah, teaching consent is absolutely vital because apparently some people missed the memo. It's frustrating as hell to see that we haven't come as far as we thought we have.

So let's stop pretending like this is some optional lesson and start holding people accountable for their actions. Respect boundaries, respect "no," and maybe, just maybe, we'll start making some progress in this messed up world.

Man, let me tell you about my parents' frickin' garden this year. It was a total disaster. I mean, seriously, Mother Nature must've had it out for them or something. The weather in Montana was straight-up garbage for gardening. Cold and rainy for what felt like forever, then a half-assed July with barely any heat or sun. And just when things were starting to look up at the end of July, bam! Back to mild, bordering on friggin' cold. 

Can you believe it? Their tomatoes? Worthless. Peppers? Pathetic. Carrots? Laughable. Cucumbers? Useless. And don't even get me started on those sad excuses for herbs. Basil and...uh, I can't even remember the other one 'cause it was so forgettable. 

But you know what did thrive in this hellhole of a summer? Freakin' zucchinis, man. Those things didn't give a single crap about the weather. They produced like crazy. My parents ended up giving away paper grocery bags full of zucchinis to my girlfriend, random people passing by, whoever dared to step foot in their alley. And guess what? They were force-feeding themselves zucchini all summer long too. Fried zucchini, zucchini noodles, baked zucchini...you name it, they tried it. Damn things just don't give a damn.

Alright, listen up, folks. This whole eternity thing, it's a real mind boggler, I tell ya. The Bible says hell is eternal, so it must be true, right? But here's the kicker, if hell ain't eternal, then heaven can't be either. It's like a package deal or something.

Now, as for all these other questions, let me hit you with this truth bomb: God is righteous, merciful, loving, and all that jazz. He's way smarter than us mere mortals, so who are we to question his grand plan? He's literally in control of the entire freakin' universe, and no matter how much we think we understand, we don't! So, just shut your trap, follow his word, obey him like a good little sheep, and wait till you kick the bucket to ask him yourself. Got it? Good. Now go on and live your life, ya sinners!
------
Look, I get where you're coming from, but I gotta call bullshit on this one. They had an agreement, sure, but that doesn't mean the money owed shouldn't be taken into consideration. I mean, seriously, who just brushes off the fact that someone owes them money like it ain't no big deal? That's some straight-up nonsense.

Yeah, OP has every right to be angry at this jerkwad's behavior. I mean, who wants to go to a concert with someone who treats them like crap? No one, that's who. But let's not forget that this so-called agreement was made on the condition that the money was paid. It's not a separate issue, it's part of the damn agreement.

Sure, the guy held up his end of the deal and deserves his ticket. But that doesn't mean he gets a free pass on paying back what he owes. It's about principle, man. So yeah, give him his ticket, but make damn sure he knows he still owes that money.
------
Lol, talk about a classic Wile E. Coyote moment! This dude never learns, does he? I mean, seriously, how many times is he gonna try and catch that darn Road Runner just to end up getting squashed like a pancake? It's like he's addicted to failure or something.

But hey, props to the ACME company for coming up with the most useless safety harness ever. I mean, what's the point of having it if it's just gonna keep him tied to the rocket and burn him alive? Talk about a major design flaw right there. Maybe they should focus on creating rockets that actually work instead of these ridiculous contraptions.

Anyway, that explosion and mushroom cloud when he hits the ground is just icing on the cake. Poor Wile E. can't catch a break, can he? But hey, at least he took down a chunk of that cliff with him. Maybe next time he'll have better luck...or maybe not. Who knows with this guy?

Yo, what up fellow Redditors? So, I've been having this weird thing with my knuckles lately and I wanna see if anyone else can relate. So, like, I used to crack my knuckles all the time, you know, that satisfying pop sound? But now it seems like my knuckle cracking gauge is running low or something. Like, I try to force them to crack, but it's not happening as much anymore. Has anyone experienced this?

Oh, and here's the thing, there are two types of knuckle cracks I do. The "hard" ones that make a loud noise and can be heard from freaking miles away, and the "soft" ones that are quieter and can only be heard if you're right next to me. Weird, right? But the soft ones actually give me more discomfort. I used to do them a lot, but I don't anymore, and I think they might have caused some pain.

Also, can we talk about cracking shoulders? I used to crack my left shoulder too, but one day it hurt like a b*tch and scared the crap outta me. Now, I still know how to crack it, but it's like my shoulder forgot how to cooperate or something.

Alright, that's enough of my knuckle and shoulder cracking adventures. Anybody else got some thoughts or experiences to share? Hit me up! Peace out!

Wow, big surprise, they're still figuring out where this scumbag is gonna be held in prison. I mean, why are they even bothering? Just throw his sorry ass in the worst cell possible and be done with it. It's not like he deserves any special treatment or anything. And what's with all this evaluation crap? Age and sexually violent predator assessment? Seriously? Just lock him up and throw away the key already. Who cares about his needs and health issues? He didn't give a damn about anyone else when he was out there doing whatever messed up stuff he did. Ugh, I can't believe they're wasting time on this. We all know he's gonna be locked up forever anyway. Good riddance.
------
Okay, so here's the deal. I've been thinking about this whole universe expanding thing, and it's really messing with my head. Apparently, the universe is expanding at this constant speed, but get this - it's not actually moving faster than light. It's just that the farthest objects seem to be zooming away from us.

To help you understand, picture a bunch of firemen holding a big-ass blanket. They're all slowly backing away at the same pace. Now, to each fireman, it looks like they're moving relative to their neighbor. But if you're standing in the middle, it's like everyone is moving away at the same freakin' speed.

But wait, it gets even weirder. If you were to put a little ball on the blanket between you and the firemen, it would look like that ball is moving away slower than the firemen. Even though the damn blanket is making sure everything moves at a constant speed. Like, what the actual hell?

So, here's the thing. Special relativity tells us that nothing can go faster than light. But then general relativity comes along and says, "Who cares? The blanket is stretching, so screw light's speed." And just like that, things get more complicated than my love life. Can someone just make it simple for once? Please?
------
Wow, you really think waiters and their service are that important, huh? I mean, come on, who cares if they're nice or not? I go to restaurants for the damn food, not to have someone fawn all over me. Why should I have to pay extra just because some waiter smiled at me and refilled my water? I can do that myself, thank you very much.

And don't even get me started on tipping. Yeah, I tip, but only because society pressures me to. It's not like I feel guilty or anything if I don't leave a big tip. If they can't afford to pay their employees a decent wage, that's not my problem.

Honestly, it's ridiculous that some places won't serve you if you can't afford to tip. I mean, what if I'm having a rough month and can barely scrape together enough money for a meal? Are they just gonna kick me out? Such BS.

So yeah, nice rant, but sorry, I'm not buying into this whole "service is everything" crap. Just give me my food and let me eat in peace.

Alright, listen up guys, I've got a bunch of complaints about this new version of the game. First off, all those skin packs I spent my hard-earned cash on in the legacy edition? Yeah, well, they don't transfer over. And guess what? Most of the cool skins are locked behind a frickin' paywall! How lame is that?

Oh, and here's another gem. Mobile players can use custom skins, but we're stuck with the ones they made for us. Seriously? Talk about being left out in the cold.

And don't even get me started on the menu. It's like they just did a copy and paste job from the old version. It's confusing as hell compared to the legacy menu. At least they're finally fixing it, but it's about time!

And if you want to play with your buddies on different platforms, good luck with that. The cross-platform play is so buggy, unless by some miracle the host is on a computer or mobile. It's a total mess.

Oh, and let's not forget the inventory. It's completely different from the legacy version, and it's

Wow, seriously? Are you actually trying to defend a pedophile here? I don't care how much punishment he received or how long he spent in jail, it's never going to be enough. Just because he served his time doesn't mean he deserves any sort of sympathy or acceptance from society. And don't even try to compare sexual attraction to adolescents to mental illnesses like suicidal thoughts and depression. That's just ridiculous. Pedophilia is sick and disgusting, plain and simple. These predators don't deserve rehabilitation or second chances, they deserve to be locked up forever. Society shouldn't have to waste its time and money on trying to reform these sickos. So stop with your pathetic attempts at defending them and wake up to the reality of how messed up they truly are.

Yo, so here's the deal, right? If you weren't born a Jew, those rabbis are gonna give you a hard time if you try to convert. They gotta make sure you really want it or something. Like, they'll straight up say no at least twice before they even consider letting you in on the action. It's all about your soul, man. They believe it can become Jewish or some deep stuff like that.

Now, let's say you're a Christian wanting to make aliyah to Israel, it's gonna be a freaking problem, bro. Yeah, the laws and stuff are gonna mess with you. See, if you're an ethnic Jew, they want you to be a religious Jew or maybe even chill as a secular Jew. But if you're coming from a Christian background, sorry dude, your heritage don't count for squat. You gotta go through the same process as all them gentiles. It's a bummer, yo.

Check this out, even though I'm like 53% Jewish according to my DNA test, I gotta convert if I wanna make aliyah. My mom wasn't Jewish and my dad was pretty secular until he got all orthodox like 20 years ago. Can you believe that? It's crazy, man. Life's weird sometimes.
------
Honestly, I don't get why people make such a big deal about relationships and sacrifices. Like, seriously, who has time for that? I mean, if my partner had the audacity to ask me to give up something as simple as porn, you can bet your ass I'd dump them faster than you can say "bodily autonomy." 

I'm all about putting myself first, because let's face it, no one else is gonna do it for you. If you're not happy, how can you possibly make someone else happy? It's like trying to pour from an empty cup, you know? So, yeah, I won't hesitate to kick someone to the curb if they're not making me feel good.

Sure, maybe some people are okay with settling and being miserable, but not me. Life's too short to waste it on someone who doesn't care about your happiness. We're just wired differently, I guess. And hey, if you're cool sacrificing your own joy and pleasure, more power to you. But count me out.
------
Okay, let me get this straight. You're saying that if someone argues that misplays shouldn't be fixed with balance patches, then it's also irrelevant to you? Dude, come on! The different races in the game play completely differently and require different strategies and control. So obviously their quality of life changes are gonna be different too. 

I mean, seriously, canceling a researching ability just to lift a building attached to a tech lab is like the least impactful change ever. It's pretty common sense if you ask me. But let's talk about the real game-changers here, like the stupid auto attack for templars or the whole burrow/unburrow thing. Those actually have a huge impact on the game. But hey, I guess those things wouldn't even matter if you had "perfect control," right? 

Man, some people just don't get it.

Wow, seriously? You really think he doesn't need to go after Russia? Are you living in an alternate universe or something? Congress is a bunch of useless clowns who can't agree on anything, so don't expect them to handle anything properly. As for your so-called "plan" to fight Russia, do you really think anyone in the US has a clue? They're too busy tweeting and playing golf to come up with a solid strategy. And let's not even get started on tariffs. Sure, they serve a purpose, but in this case, they're just a joke. Russia already had low trade with us, so what's the point of slapping on more tariffs? It's like trying to punish someone by taking away something they don't even want. Seriously, before you start spouting off, maybe try thinking about the bigger picture for once. But hey, that might be too much to ask from someone like you.
------
Dude, seriously? Are you trying to shift the blame here? It's because of ignorant comments like yours that women struggle in male-dominated environments. I deal with this shit every single day at work, and it's infuriating how women can't catch a break without someone insinuating that they sleep with anything that moves. It's a toxic cesspool, and we need to call it out, even if it's just a joke. Look, there's no shame in having casual encounters, but that doesn't give anyone the right to assume, make jokes, or spread rumors about someone's sex life.

And hey, I'm not saying I'm innocent either. I've been that jackass who perpetuated this crap before. But seriously, let's all try to be a little less dickish, alright? It's not that hard to make an effort and treat people with basic respect.

I can't believe how judgmental people can be when it comes to body modification. Like seriously, why do we care so much about what other people do to their bodies? It's their choice! If someone wants fake boobs to boost their self-esteem and feel more confident, who are we to judge? It's no different than getting a haircut or wearing makeup. And let's not forget about the double standards here. Society seems to have no problem with women having massive boobs, but as soon as someone goes under the knife to achieve it, suddenly it's an issue. Hypocritical much? People need to mind their own damn business and stop policing others' bodies. Let people do what makes them happy and comfortable. End of story.

Yeah, I totally agree with you. AVX was a total mess, dude. The X-Men comics have been going downhill for ages now. It's like they always come up with cool stuff and then ruin it with some stupid big event. And don't even get me started on Cyclops in Infinity War, man. What a joke.

Honestly, there are way better X-Men stories that they could adapt before even considering AVX. Like, why not do a crossover that actually involves the whole damn country or world? That would be way more epic and interesting.

But hey, I guess I sorta trust Marvel Studios to not completely screw up their own characters. Maybe if they really wanted to, they could salvage AVX. But the more I think about it and talk to people, the more I realize that any other crossover would be way better. They could just take the good parts from AVX and stick 'em in something else, you know?

Um, what the hell are you even trying to say here? Your argument is all over the place and doesn't make any damn sense. First of all, nobody said anything about Asians being superior humans. So why the hell are you bringing that shit up? We're talking about making education accessible to all communities, especially those that are struggling. And yeah, some people can succeed if they go to Harvard and work their asses off, but that's not the point. The point is that there are barriers and inequalities in society that prevent many people from even having a fair shot at getting into top-notch schools. Head start programs might not be perfect, but they're a step in the right direction to level the playing field. And don't even get me started on your nonsense about other countries. Yeah, sure, maybe some countries have better primary school education, but that doesn't mean we should just give up and accept the crappy system we have here. We should be fighting for change and improvement, not making excuses. So get your head out of your ass and join the real conversation.

hey guys, just wanted to give you all an update on my vac ban situation. So, a few months back, I made a post whining about how I got banned for cheating when I totally didn't. And guess what? Turns out, Steam support finally reached out to me (shocking, I know) and confirmed that it was not my fault at all. Apparently, it was some damn malware that triggered the ban! Can you believe it?

I mean, seriously, I had given up all hope, but now my faith in humanity (well, Steam support at least) has been partially restored. I've already gone ahead and reinstalled Windows and changed my password to be on the safe side. But honestly, I couldn't find any traces of malware before reinstalling, so who the hell knows what caused it.

Anyways, shoutout to all the cool peeps who actually believed me and gave me advice. You guys rock! I'm just glad I can finally get back to playing without being labeled as a cheater. Peace out!

Okay, seriously, I don't get why people worship Kanye West so much. Yeah, he's a talented artist, but that doesn't give him a free pass to be a total asshole and spread dangerous ideas about mental health. I mean, come on, mania as a superpower? That's just straight up delusional. I get that everyone's journey with mental health is unique, but encouraging bipolar people to avoid treating their mania is just plain irresponsible. Mania can be just as deadly as depression, and it's not something to be glorified. And don't even get me started on his anti-medication rants. It's like he's actively trying to discourage people from getting the help they need. So yeah, Kanye may be a sick individual, but that doesn't excuse his ignorant and harmful behavior. It sucks that he has such a big platform and chooses to use it to spread damaging ideas instead of promoting healthy treatment options. What a disappointment.
------
Ugh, I can't believe some parents these days! Like seriously, who do they think they are? This OP is just trying to express themselves and their stupid parents completely shut them down. It's ridiculous. I mean, respect goes both ways, people! If your parents can't even listen to your side of things and then go and slap you? That's messed up. Parents should be supporting their kids, not treating them like crap. And just because the OP is younger doesn't mean their thoughts and feelings don't matter. It's like these parents have a power trip or something. So messed up. No wonder kids these days rebel. Can't blame them. These parents need a reality check.
------
Ok, I gotta vent about this. Can we talk about how clueless some of these product people are? Like seriously, they think they're geniuses just because they came up with a half-baked idea and rushed it to the market. But guess what? Their software sucks! It's full of bugs and crashes all the time. And don't even get me started on their understanding of quality control.

I mean, come on! The whole point of having a separate team for software development is to ensure that things actually work properly. But no, these so-called "founder types" think they can do it all. And of course, they never admit that they don't know what they're doing.

So here we are, stuck with their crappy software and a company culture that values speed over quality. It's a mess, and there's no way to fix it. These people need a reality check, ASAP. Maybe then we can actually have reliable software and not just some half-assed solution that falls apart after a week. Ugh!
------
Dude, seriously? What are you even talking about? Your whole argument is a mess. First off, why the hell are you using California and New York as data models for South Korea? They're completely different places with different cultures and laws. It makes no sense whatsoever.

And then you start going on about how most victims suffer from interpersonal violence and how the majority of sex offenders aren't strangers to their victims. Okay, cool. But what does that have to do with anything? Are you saying that means we shouldn't be concerned about the prevalence of sexual crimes? That's messed up, man.

And don't even get me started on your population density argument. Landmass does matter because it affects how many people are packed into an area. And hey, newsflash, our building codes aren't the same as Korean building codes. So what's your point?

And finally, you try to belittle this criminology professor's research by saying they made "shitty leaps and bounds with data". Well, guess what? Maybe you should take your genius conclusions and submit them to a professor and see how far you get. I'm sure they'll be rolling on the floor laughing.

Sorry, but your whole post is just a bunch of confounding factors and nonsense. Try again, buddy.
------
Alright, listen up everyone. I'm just a dumb college freshman, but let me drop some wisdom on you about being a Christian. See, in my expert opinion, every person's relationship with God is unique, just like how we're all special snowflakes. There's no one-size-fits-all approach to following Him and loving Him. So if anyone tells you otherwise, they're full of crap.

And hey, guess what? God totally gets it if you can't drag your lazy butt to church or if you simply don't feel like going. He's cool like that, you know? So don't let those judgmental pricks make you feel guilty for skipping Sunday service. You do you, boo!

These close-minded people need to loosen up and quit pretending they're the holy gatekeepers. They have no business judging you or your actions. Only God has that privilege. So next time someone tries to tell you how to be a believer, tell 'em to buzz off! Because in the end, it's between you and Big G-Man upstairs. Peace out, y'all.

Man, I gotta say, I used to use Keepass and it was pretty solid. But then I switched to Lastpass because I realized the importance of being able to hand over account passwords in case something crazy happens like, I dunno, death! 

Now don't get me wrong, Keepass can do that too, but damn, it requires some serious technical knowhow. You gotta be a frickin' wizard to set it up properly and explain it to the poor soul who's gonna inherit your login deets. 

But with Lastpass, man, it's a breeze! You can set up this thing called a "dead mans" switch, where you give someone else the power to request access to your passwords. And if you don't deny it in a certain timeframe, bam, they get access to all or some of your precious vault contents. Easy peasy lemon squeezy, baby!
------
Hey guys, I gotta rant about this Kavanaugh situation. Like seriously, what the hell is going on? These accusations are flying left and right, and everyone's losing their minds. I mean, yeah, sure, some guys can be total assholes when it comes to women, but does that mean they're automatically guilty of everything they're accused of?

Look, I get it, sexual misconduct is no joke. But come on, are we really gonna start believing every damn story that pops up? It just seems fishy to me that these allegations conveniently pop up when someone's up for an important position. Like, you really think these women suddenly remembered what happened decades ago? Give me a break.

And don't even get me started on Bill Clinton and Trump. Those guys have been accused left and right, but they still got away with it. Why? Because they're powerful dudes, that's why. It's clear as day that these accusations are politically motivated.

Look, if Kavanaugh did all those things, then yeah, he's a scumbag. But until there's some real evidence or a court conviction, can we just calm the hell down? There are plenty of other conservative judges out there who could fill the role just fine. So let's focus on that instead of jumping to conclusions, alright? Peace out.

Dude, macs are the bomb for devs! I mean, they're not just for iOS developers, but also for web devs and all kinds of developers. And the reason? It's because macOS is a Unix-based system, just like Linux, which is every dev's dream come true. Unlike Windows, which is like bottom of the barrel for development.

But wait, there's more! Apple's hardware is freaking amazing. They've got top-notch quality and reliability, plus insane battery life. You can trust your Macbook to keep chugging along even after 10 freaking years, man. It might be slow by then, but who cares, it still works! Windows, on the other hand, outsourced their OS to third parties, so their hardware ain't as optimized as Apple's.

That's why iPhones with lower specs can still kick ass compared to android phones, and why Macbooks with lower specs can run circles around their Windows counterparts. And hey, props to Microsoft Surface for trying to catch up and adapt to Apple's ecosystem strategy. Maybe they'll finally get their stuff together.

Seriously? Who needs a chef when you can cook a damn steak yourself? It's not rocket science, people! I bet half of these so-called "chefs" can't even make a decent microwave popcorn. And don't get me started on the bartenders who think they're some kind of gods for pouring a beer. I can do that just fine, thank you very much. 

I'm all about keeping it simple, none of those fancy marinades or rubs. Just give me some salt and pepper, maybe slather on a cheap bourbon onion glaze if I want to go wild. And voila, you've got yourself a restaurant-quality steak! That's why I never bother going out for steak anymore. Why waste my hard-earned cash when I can make it better at home?

But hey, let's be real. Cooking steak is a piece of cake. I prefer a challenge, something that'll blow my mind and make me question my entire existence in the kitchen. Give me a dish that's so complicated, there's no way in hell I could replicate it myself. That's where the real fun is!
------
Ugh, seriously? This guy is a total mess. He knows his political career is over and he's just grasping at straws now, trying to drag everyone else down with him. And of course, he starts with Marshall Quadbox because he's the one who's been getting under his skin. I bet by next week, he'll start spouting off names of Labor MPs who have gotten on his nerves.

But here's the thing, we should all be a little worried because if the Dems completely take over in the midterms, it's gonna be chaos just like this. I'm talking about a Senate majority that can't be stopped and maybe even a slim majority in the House. And let me tell you, when Trump eventually crashes and burns, it'll be like comparing a firecracker to freaking Hiroshima. The global impact is gonna be insane, mark my words.

I don't understand why people think instant coffee is even drinkable. It's like drinking dirty water with a hint of coffee flavor. I mean, seriously, who wants that? I tried it once because I was too lazy to make a proper cup of coffee, and it was such a disappointment. No wonder they have to add all those fancy flavors and creamers just to make it somewhat tolerable. And don't even get me started on those sachets of "mocha" or "caramel" flavor, they taste like straight-up chemicals.

If you want a real cup of coffee, invest in a French press or a good old drip coffee maker. You know, something that actually takes time to brew and extract the flavors properly. Maybe then you'll understand what a good cup of coffee tastes like. But hey, who am I to judge? I only drink coffee to survive the chaos of having a one-year-old. Cheers, fellow sleep-deprived parents!

Look, I get it. You're trying to make a point about the mindset of people within political parties, and how it affects their ability to work together for the benefit of future generations. But let's be real for a second. Are you seriously suggesting that every single person in a political party has the same mindset? Come on now, that's just ridiculous.

Sure, there might be some generalizations and cognitive dissonance in certain mindsets, especially among older folks. But hey, that's not exclusive to one party or another. People are complex creatures with their own unique thoughts and opinions. And yes, sometimes those opinions clash with each other. That's called individuality.

But here's the thing. When you say that voting for a particular party is a vote against giving future generations a better life, I have to call BS. Nobody consciously takes that position. It's just not a fair statement to make. And even if someone did have that mindset, good luck finding a forum or party where you can openly discuss that point without getting shut down immediately.

So, let's try to have a real conversation here, without making sweeping generalizations or shutting down opposing viewpoints. Can we do that?
------
I don't get the point of this "contributor covenant" thing. It just seems like a bunch of unnecessary rules and restrictions. Who cares what some random person finds offensive? Shouldn't it be about the intention behind what someone says, rather than how it's perceived? And the list of "unacceptable" behavior is so vague, anyone can interpret it however they want. So basically, you have to tiptoe around and never say anything that might offend someone. That's boring and unrealistic. Plus, now they want to police what you say on social media or in public forums too? Give me a break. And don't even get me started on the confidentiality aspect. Why should someone's report be kept secret? In real life, everything is public when there's a problem. But here, they expect us to trust some anonymous judgment? No thanks, I'll pass.
------
Wow, there are so many things wrong with your post that I don't even know where to begin. First of all, your grammar and sentence structure are a complete disaster. Seriously, did you even bother proofreading this mess before you hit that "post" button?

But let's move on to the actual content. Are you seriously trying to claim that land rights and oil fields have anything to do with some random brown person getting a leg up? Talk about a huge leap in logic. And what's with the whole "stolen treaty lands" argument? That happened centuries ago, get over it already.

And don't even get me started on your claims about equality and fairness. Do you honestly believe that demanding full restoration of ancient treaties is going to magically solve all our problems? Newsflash: it won't.

So, please, spare us all your self-righteous preachy nonsense. This subreddit is for real discussions, not for your baseless rants. Maybe try actually educating yourself before you come here spewing this nonsense next time. Thanks.
------
Yo, I can't help but notice that you got downvoted, and honestly, I can see why. But hey, check out this badass candy website I found! Apparently, the Mars Bar changed its name to Snickers Almond Bar in 2000. It's got roasted almonds, nougat, caramel, and milk chocolate. Sounds freaking delicious, right? Now, I gotta admit, I'm Canadian, so I don't have first-hand experience with this candy transformation, but hey, at least I did some "research" on Mars Bars instead of doing my actual work. And here's the best part - someone else already explained this to you in the comment right below! You literally posted the same damn link! Haha, reading comprehension, my friend. Gotta love it. Anyways, keep scrolling and try not to get called out on your lack of attention next time!
------
Wow, your post is filled with so much negativity and disrespect. It's important to remember that everyone has different preferences when it comes to dating and attraction. Age should never be used as a basis for insulting or belittling someone. Beauty and desirability are subjective, and it's not fair to make sweeping generalizations about people based on their age.

Furthermore, your comment about women being "rented" with attention is extremely disrespectful and dehumanizing. Relationships should be based on mutual love, respect, and genuine connection, not on some transactional mindset. It's clear that you have some misconceptions about dating and relationships, and I would encourage you to approach the topic with more empathy and open-mindedness.

Lastly, using derogatory language to describe sexual performance and body features is inappropriate and offensive. It's not productive or respectful to mock someone based on their physical attributes. Let's strive for a more positive and inclusive discussion in this subreddit.
------
Are you seriously that blind and idiotic to think that labeling a freaking neo-nazi as some kind of hero is remotely acceptable? Like, come on, it's not rocket science. This dude was already infamous for his neo-nazi beliefs, and you decide to date him AND interview him about Nietzsche's connection to fascism? Are you kidding me? And then you have the audacity to call yourself an anti-fascist? Give me a break.

I mean, seriously, there are countless other words you could use to describe this scumbag, but no, you just had to go with "tragic hero." Are you out of your damn mind? Do you even understand the impact of your words? It's like you're trying to normalize his abhorrent beliefs or something. Get a grip, moron, and choose your words more wisely next time.
------
Look, I get it. Some people might think that all cops are bad, but come on! Let's not pretend that there aren't some seriously messed up things happening out there. It's not unreasonable for people to be skeptical and not trust the police force when they consistently turn a blind eye to abuse and treat marginalized communities like garbage.

I mean, seriously, if you want people to start trusting you, maybe start by acknowledging the shitshow that has been going on. Cops need to be held accountable for their actions, plain and simple. But instead, we see denial after denial, acting like there's no problem at all. How can we trust an armed group of people who refuse to even admit that they have issues?

And don't even get me started on cops targeting LGBT folks. I can only imagine how many times you and your buddies have shared a good laugh at the expense of innocent queer people just living their lives. It's disgusting.

So yeah, maybe instead of playing the victim card and whining about people not trusting you, try focusing on fixing the massive problems within your own system. Just a thought.
------
Alright, listen up y'all. Here's the thing: I'm sick and tired of hearing people go on and on about how maximizing profit is the be-all and end-all for every darn company out there. Newsflash, folks! Real life ain't a freakin' textbook!

Let me break it down for you simpletons. Companies have all sorts of crazy factors messing with their profit game. Take those sneaky sales teams, for example. They got these dumb benchmarks set based on last year's performance. So what do they do? They aim to barely scrape by those targets like a bunch of lazy bums. Why? 'Cause if they go above and beyond, they'll make it harder for themselves next year. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot!

But here's the kicker, my peeps. The sad truth is, if that company focused on making more sales, they'd actually be raking in more dough. It's as plain as day! But no, let's just settle for mediocrity. Why bother aiming for the stars when we can settle for a measly slice of the profit pie?

So, to sum it up, forget about those fancy econ theories and think about the real world. Companies ain't always on that profit-grabbing train, and it's about time we stopped pretending they are. Peace out!
------
OMG, I totally feel you on this! Seriously, what the hell is wrong with people these days? How can you not know how to do your own basic shit by the time you hit 28? It's mind-boggling. Like, come on, buddy, pull your goddamn weight!

And don't even get me started on his girlfriend enabling him. I mean, seriously, what kind of relationship is that? She's practically his damn mom doing everything for him. How can you respect someone like that? It's pathetic.

I'm telling you, if I were in her shoes, I would've dumped his lazy ass a long time ago. Ain't nobody got time for someone who can't even take care of themselves. It's 2021, for crying out loud!

But hey, like you said, to each their own. Maybe they're into that weird-ass dynamic. Personally, I need a partner who can adult like a normal freakin' person. Basic life skills shouldn't be too much to ask for, right?
------
Wow, thanks for bringing up this topic. Gotta say, Augustus was a real father figure for me when my old man kicked the bucket. That dude had some similarities to my pops, and it helped me process the whole grieving mess. Yeah, it's cliché, but he made me feel like a freakin' kid again, you know? Like, I could just be myself and he accepted me without any strings attached. And that's a rare thing for me, 'cause I was this child prodigy who always had to prove myself. But with Augustus, I could just be a woman, doing my thing. Plus, he inspired the hell outta me artistically, even though I can't fully explain why. Anyway, even though the guy is no longer in my life, I'm still carryin' the impact he had on me. So yeah, I'm grateful for that.

Now, let's talk about his mental illness, 'cause I think it plays a part in all the messed up stuff he's done. Don't get me wrong, I condemn any domestic violence or his messed up politics. I'm fightin' against that in the real world. But in some abstract way, I can't help but feel some compassion for the guy. Like, I see him as a wild animal, y'know? You're not pissed at a lion just for being a lion. You just gotta stay outta its way and keep it from hurting others.
------
Ok, seriously, who the hell cares about the stock status of tuna? Like, does anyone actually sit around and read a whole freakin' report on this stuff? I mean, sure, I get that some people are all about saving the planet and whatnot, but come on, there's gotta be more important things to worry about. And don't even get me started on these so-called "useful studies" on rebuilding tuna stocks. Who has time to read some outdated crap? 

And seafood watch recommendations? Seriously? Is this like a guide for snobby people who only eat the finest, most sustainable fish? Just give me a damn can of tuna and I'm good! I don't need some fancy website telling me what kind of fish is "acceptable" to eat. 

Look, I'm not saying everything is perfect with the tuna situation, but can we stop with all this overthinking and fear-mongering? Some tuna is fine, so let's just chill out and enjoy our tuna sandwiches, alright?
------
Honestly, it's crazy how much people's attitude changes based on your weight. I mean, I work my ass off to stay in shape, running like a maniac and lifting weights like a beast, but my weight still goes up and down like a yo-yo. And damn, when I gain some pounds, people treat me like garbage. It's like they suddenly lose interest in being around me just because I'm not a skinny little twig.

But you know what? I've realized that maybe it's not all their fault. When I'm feeling down and anxious, it's like a vicious cycle where the weight gain makes people less interested in me, which brings me down even more. But when I shed those pounds, people start being friendly again, and it helps me get out of my own funk. It sucks that I used to blame everyone else for their shallow behavior, but now I see that my own attitude played a part in it too.

So yeah, I've learned to be more conscious of how my weight affects my mood and how people treat me. It's a tough battle, but being aware of it definitely makes the swings a bit easier to handle.
------
Man, Santa Monica Airport is such a joke. Can you believe those damn homeowners who just want to make a quick buck? They don't care about anything else but their precious property values. And don't even get me started on the people who think it'll become some kind of beautiful park. Yeah right, more like a huge condo complex. Just what we need, more traffic and overpriced housing. Santa Monica doesn't give a crap about the consequences, they're too busy counting their fat stacks of property tax money. And who's going to deal with all the infrastructure problems? You guessed it, LA city. Ugh, it's so frustrating!
------
Yo, what the actual fuck is up with the justice system? I mean, seriously, how messed up is it that innocent people can get locked up just because they *look* like a suspect? Like what happened to "innocent until proven guilty"? It's straight up bullshit. And don't even get me started on these lazy-ass cops who can't be bothered to actually investigate properly. It's like they just arrest anyone who vaguely fits the description and call it a day. And then, on top of all that, imagine if some crazy disaster strikes and you're stuck in your cell, left to die. That's some next level fucked up shit right there. I can't even wrap my head around it. Just goes to show you can't trust the system, man.
------
Man, I totally get where you're coming from, but let's be real here. If you decide to open up your device and go all Rambo on it, don't expect the company to hold your hand when things go south. I mean, come on! It's basic common sense. You tamper with something, you take responsibility for whatever happens next. Companies can't read minds, bro! They can't magically know if you screwed something up while tinkering with your device.

And seriously, why should they have to cover your mistake? It's not their fault you thought you were a tech expert when you clearly ain't. We should have the right to repair our own shit, sure, but that doesn't mean companies should be on the hook for our screw-ups. They can't control what dumb stuff people do with their devices, so they shouldn't be held accountable for it. Just my two cents, dude. So think twice before playing around with your precious gadgets!
------
Listen up, folks! As a regular Joe living right by the border, let me give you the lowdown on what's really going on. Forget about all those fancy debates, it's the freaking border violence that's the real problem here. I'm telling you, the quality of care ain't that different between Mexico and the US. Sure, you might think Mexico is all unsafe and all, but guess what? A bunch of those border areas are crawling with drug violence.

Now, hold your horses, 'cause I'm not here to bash Mexico. In fact, their dental and health care providers know darn well about their country's crappy reputation. So, they bust their butts extra hard to make sure you get top-notch treatment. Talk about motivation, am I right?

But seriously, don't let those safety concerns scare you away. Mexico may have its flaws, but when it comes to dental and health care, they sure know how to step up their game. You won't be disappointed, trust me. Just watch out for those drug dealers while you're at it!
------
Listen, I gotta be honest here. I think this whole augmented reality thing you're talking about is just a bunch of hype. I mean, come on. Embedding videos and images into walls? What's the point? Why not just give the kids a damn website?

And don't even get me started on the battery drain and having to point your phone at a wall. Like, seriously? Is that really necessary? Just give them a regular old website and call it a day.

But you know what? I'll give you one thing. If they used augmented reality in a physics classroom, that could actually be pretty cool. You know, like adjusting variables on a 3D catapult and seeing how the equations and behavior change in real-time. Now that's some useful stuff right there.

But let me tell you something. My brother's high school gave them all these rental iPads, and it was a disaster. The teachers just used it as an excuse not to teach. It was more about playing games and surfing the web than actual learning.

So yeah, call me a skeptic, but I just don't see the point of this whole augmented reality thing in the classroom. It's just a fancy gimmick if you ask me.
------
Look, I get it. You Eren fanboys are out here acting like he's some kind of god, but let's be real for a second. Eva 01 would wipe the floor with that whiny bitch in a heartbeat. Don't even try to deny it.

First off, let's talk about the durability. Titans are like delicate little flowers compared to Evas. Those big ass Titans can't handle a punch without crumbling into a million pieces, while Evas are built to last. They can take a beating and keep on going.

And don't even get me started on the AT field. Eren's Titan doesn't have shit on the invincibility of an Eva. That AT field would deflect any attack Eren throws at it like it's nothing. Good luck breaking through that, buddy.

Now, let's talk about the pilots. Shinji may be a crybaby, but he's got skills. He's methodical and trained, unlike Eren who just charges in blindly, fueled by anger. Shinji keeps his cool and actually knows how to fight. Plus, he's taken down more Angels than Eren has Titans, no question.

Lastly, let's not forget that Eva 01 can tap into some crazy eldritch powers. Can you imagine a Titan with Mikasa's athletic ability? Yeah, exactly. Eren wouldn't stand a chance against that kind of powerhouse.

So, sorry Eren stans, but when it comes down to it, Eva 01 would kick Eren's ass any day of the week. Deal with it.
------
Honestly, I think she totally overreacted to the negative feedback. Like seriously, who does that? She's an old lady about to retire, and she's scared of a bunch of college students giving their honest opinion? It's not like any of us were attacking her personally or anything. All she had to do was ask for help, like someone to make a stupid PowerPoint or PDF presentation with her slides. That would have solved the whole damn issue in a weekend. But nah, she had to go all drama queen and try to scare us into compliance. And when that didn't work, she just had to push it till the end. I mean, come on! 

But you know what, I did learn a couple of things from this whole mess. First, even if you didn't do anything wrong, you can still suffer the consequences. It's just easier for people to blame a whole group rather than point fingers at one person. Second, when someone asks for feedback, they usually just want to hear good things. They can't handle the truth and take it personally. So yeah, life lessons learned, thanks to this crazy lady.

Why are we still talking about this? Yeah, he messed up, but haven't we all? Robert Downey Jr. was a damn drug addict and everyone thinks he's a goddamn hero now. So why can't we cut this guy some slack?

And seriously, it's just acting. Who gives a flying fuck if he said some dumb shit or did some stupid things in the past? He paid his dues, didn't he? Let the dude move on with his life and deal with his own demons however he wants.

Honestly, I'm sick of society acting like anyone who's made a mistake deserves to be banished forever. If you do the time, you should get a second chance. It's not like he murdered someone or anything.

So let the guy have a shot at redemption and stop making such a big fucking deal about it. Move on, people.

How much is all this stat swapping crap costing you per week anyways? Like, seriously, I've got a mix of gear for different game modes and team comps. Fractal set with some commanders and zerker gear, tanking with givers. And let me tell you, I barely spend anything on swapping stats now. I can just dial it up or down as needed. Pretty sweet, right?

But hey, my goal is to get full legendary so I can jump back into WvW support and try out Mirage. It's been fun roaming with it. So how long do you think it'll take me to finish this legendary grind? I just finished the gorseval timegate, which took like 5 weeks because you need 5 kills for his trophy. Now I just gotta learn some W2 and Xera from W3 and then it's smooth sailing, or so I hope.

Honestly, I have no idea how much longer it'll take, but who cares? I'm just stoked to keep raiding and getting better at the game. I'm even volunteering to tank in training discords, even if I already got my weekly credit. The time it takes to get legendary is nothing compared to the time I'll keep raiding.

Wow, your understanding of history is seriously flawed. It's obvious you haven't done any proper research before spouting nonsense like this. Sure, there might not have been a lot of universities back then, but that doesn't mean women didn't face discrimination. Just because Marie Curie managed to attend the University of Paris and win a Nobel Prize, doesn't mean all women had the same opportunities. She was an exception, not the norm.

And talking about women being best-selling authors doesn't prove anything. It's like saying women were highly successful in one industry, so discrimination must not have existed. That's just plain ignorant. Discrimination takes many forms, and it's not always blatant. Just because women weren't allowed in the army during WW1 doesn't mean they weren't willing to serve their countries. Many women played crucial roles on the home front and in other vital sectors.

Do some actual research next time before making baseless claims.

So, I gotta say, Google Photos is the bomb. Like seriously, it took a freaking long time, but I managed to upload all my pics and videos under their free plan. Sure, they compress the photos and downgrade my 4k footage to 1080, but who cares? I mean, the basic functionality is all there, you know? I can scroll through this massive timeline of all my crap and reminisce about the good ol' days. And get this, I can even search through the damn thing by people or places! It's like rediscovering all these forgotten moments. Plus, bonus points for having a freaking cloud backup. I mean, come on, that's like insurance for when my drives decide to take a dump. Can't beat that, am I right?
------
Why the hell can't we just watch it live? I mean, come on! It's freaking 2021, people! With all the fancy technology we have nowadays, it's so damn easy to fake transcripts and edit audio. Having a live stream would at least help prevent those sneaky manipulations.

Oh, but no! Apparently, we can't have that because the court wants to pretend they're some high and mighty political neutral entity. Give me a break! That ship sailed ages ago! The whole nomination and confirmation process for justices is nothing but a freakin' political circus.

We, the public, deserve the right to see what the hell is happening in the highest court of the damn land! It affects us, you know? So stop hiding behind your outdated excuses and let us watch the show, dammit!

Honestly, who gives a damn about where the content comes from? As a casual Reddit user, all I care about is the quality of the content. Whether it's posted by a company or some regular Joe, it doesn't make a difference to me. If the posts and comments suck, then I'll just move on to another subreddit or even another website. Simple as that.

I mean, yeah, I get it. People who create content might have a problem with corporations taking over, but for the rest of us, what's the big deal? It's not like I'm gonna lose sleep over the fact that some corporate shill is feeding me interesting stuff. Hell, they could all be bots for all I care, as long as the comments and posts are entertaining and keep me hooked.

So, why should I waste my time getting worked up about who's behind the content? Give me something interesting to read, and I'm good. End of story.
------
Wow, this subreddit is full of ignorant people. I can't believe there are still idiots out there who hate others just because of their skin color. It's disgusting how they degrade and call for the deaths of people who are different from them. And don't even get me started on those red states! If you've lived in four of them and claim not to have met a single racist, you're either blind or lying. It's like they think hating someone based on their skin color isn't racist. Seriously? And let's not forget the racism towards Obama. Criticizing his policies is one thing, but accusing him of not being born in the country, calling him a secret Muslim, and even hanging and burning him in effigy? That's pure racism coming from those Republican idiots. It's pretty clear that they're all a bunch of racists.
------
naruto saw himself in sasuke and at one point even admitted that if he didn't have iruka sensei, he might have turned out the same. But what excuse did Sakura have? Seriously, she could have done so much better than that emo Sasuke. She was so dumbly infatuated with him that she just let him treat her like crap. I mean, come on! Lee was right there, waiting for her. He would have treated her like a queen and made her into a badass taijutsu ninja. Plus, imagine the power she could have gained from Tsunade and Lee combined! It's such a waste. Sakura really messed up big time. She should have ditched Sasuke and gone for someone who actually cared about her.
------
Ugh, seriously dude? You're suggesting that someone switches champions just because they want to climb? That's some dumb advice right there. And yeah, I know Shaco has combos, no need to act like you're some kind of genius for knowing that. Auto-e-tiamat or auto-tiamat-e, whoop-de-do, we all know that. And yeah, if you're AP Shaco you gotta use those stupid boxes, everyone knows that too. But guess what? Shaco ain't the beast he used to be. You can't just auto once and watch a carry get rekt anymore. That's so old school. Now, he needs items and a lead to do any real damage. Unless he's going after squishies like Janna or Nami, then he's gonna have to slowly chip away at his target. So stop acting like you're some hotshot Shaco expert when you clearly don't know jack. All his combos are the same crap in every fight, and his damage is just plain boring.

lol what's with all the fuss about a stupid shirt? like seriously, is everyone so sensitive nowadays that a piece of clothing is gonna ruin their precious "educational mission"? come on, get a grip! it's just a shirt, people! 

And why the hell did the principal and the cop have to get involved? they need to chill the f out. she's just a kid wearing a shirt, for god's sake. 

Instead of causing such a big drama over a damn t-shirt, why not just let her wear it for the day and tell her nicely not to wear it again? like, how hard is it to handle a situation without blowing it out of proportion? it's not like the school is gonna crumble just because of one shirt! 

Honestly, these people need to learn how to pick their battles. Focus on real issues instead of wasting time on some silly shirt. #priorities
------
Wow, you seriously believe that load of crap? Look, it's obvious that she's just making this whole thing up for attention or to ruin Kavanaugh's life. I mean, why would she wait so long to come forward? And her story keeps changing! First it's four guys, then it's two. That's a major red flag right there.

And don't even get me started on the whole therapist thing. Yeah, sure, the therapist wrote down a different number. But maybe the therapist got it wrong, ever think of that? It's a hell of a stretch to believe that she made up a story to her therapist years ago, only to make it up again now just to get attention.

You really need to do some research and read up on the guy defending Kavanaugh. There's a lot more to this story than meets the eye. And while you're at it, maybe look into the science of memory, especially when it comes to trauma. Your personal anecdote doesn't change the fact that memories can be fuzzy and details can get mixed up.

So stop pretending like you know everything and start actually looking into the facts before you spout off your nonsense. It's not helping your credibility, that's for damn sure.
------
Look, I get it. Everyone has their own beliefs and wants to pass them on to their kids. But for me, I don't want my future children to blindly follow a religion that's full of contradictions and prejudice. The Bible may have some good lessons, but let's be real, there's a lot of BS in there too. I want my kids to understand that they shouldn't just believe something because some religious figure said so. They should question everything and demand proof. And let's not even get started on the Catholic Church and their backward views on LGBTQ+ people. Supporting the church means supporting discrimination, plain and simple. So yeah, call me an atheist if you want, but I just want my kids to think critically and not be brainwashed by some ancient book and a bunch of close-minded religious leaders.
------
Can't believe I have to spell this out for you casuals, but there are actually situations on ST where using the RW ability can result in a frickin' gain. Yeah, I know, mind-blowing stuff. Let me break it down for you idiots:

1. Say the boss is about to run out and you only got 20 RP left. If there's only one rune up, using RW won't give you an additional tick on BoS. Duh!

2. Sometimes, your FC procs when there's only one rune up and no RP left. So you gotta try and get those re procs, even if it means using RW. Get it?

3. Here's a big brain move for ya. If you got three runes up or they're about to be up, you can hold onto two of those bad boys for a short while. Why? 'Cause you're waiting for a KM proc, duh! And don't worry, you won't lose out on FP damage. Genius!

Now, this isn't rocket science, but using RW for these incremental gains on ST ain't necessary. But hey, don't go around saying you should never use it. Just sayin'.
------
I can't believe you're asking this stupid question. Are you seriously that ignorant? It's common knowledge that for America, the turning point was after Pearl Harbor in 1941. Didn't you claim to educate me? Well, you're failing miserably. 

Sure, there was a war already happening, but the US wasn't involved until after this rally and picture were taken. Do you even understand what semantics means? Because it seems like you don't.

And don't even get me started on how you're misusing the term. It's clear that you have no idea what you're talking about, and somehow you think it's okay just because you don't agree with the actual definition? Seriously, you should just stop. It's obvious that you're not educated enough to have any kind of meaningful debate.
------
Wow, you seriously don't get it, do you? Let me break it down for ya. Zombies having more maps than usual doesn't mean squat if those maps are just recycled from the previous game. And yeah, I know Battle Royale is popular and all, but that doesn't make it better than PUBG. It's just a watered-down version of FFA with one life. Where's the fun in that? And don't even get me started on reusing assets from BO3. It's lazy as hell and shows a lack of effort on the developers' part. I mean, come on, can't they at least bring something fresh to the table? And yeah, 11 maps may sound like a decent amount, but when you're stuck playing the same map over and over again, it gets old real quick. But I guess who needs a campaign anyway, right? Just slap some mindless multiplayer modes together and call it a day. It's clear that COD singleplayer doesn't matter to most people, and that's just sad.
------
Damn, OP, I gotta be real with you here. Therapy? Are you serious? Look, I get it, divorce sucks and it can mess with your head, but going to therapy just because your friend is hanging out with your ex? That's some next-level overreaction. Terry is allowed to live her own damn life and if that means socializing with your ex, well, tough luck for you.

But hey, guess what? You have every right to feel betrayed and end the friendship too. If you think your friend can't be trusted just because she's hanging out with the same people who broke up your marriage, then maybe there's something there. Your daughter saw them together and if she thinks they're shady, maybe she's onto something.

So yeah, do what you gotta do, OP. Cut ties with Terry if it makes you feel better. But seriously, therapy? Come on, man. Let's not blow this out of proportion.
------
Alright, so I stumbled upon this post and I gotta say, what the hell is all this jargon? Are you trying to confuse us casual Redditors on purpose or what? I don't need a frickin' research paper thrown at me, man. Just tell it to me straight - does this AI thing actually work or not? Because I'm not about to waste my time reading through all this scientific mumbo jumbo. And seriously, who cares about sensitivity and specificity rates? Just tell me if it can accurately detect diabetic retinopathy or not. And comparing it to some ophthalmologist's success rate? Like, who even knows what direct ophthalmoscopy is? Keep it simple, dude. Give me the facts without all the fancy words, yeah?
------
I mean, seriously, what the hell is wrong with this chick? I get that she might have had some issues at work, but like, why does she feel the need to blast it all over social media? And tagging people, really? That's just straight up messed up. Like, if HR handled her complaints, then why the hell does she need to make it public and put everyone's business out there?

And don't even get me started on the whole married coworker thing. Just because someone asks you out and they're married doesn't automatically mean it's sexual harassment. Like, what if they have an open marriage or something? She doesn't know the full story and she could end up causing a ton of unnecessary drama. Ugh, some people just thrive on creating drama and stirring shit up. It's so annoying.
------
I don't get all the hype around this game. Sure, it's decent, but it's nothing groundbreaking. People keep praising it like it's the best thing since sliced bread, but I'm not buying into that crap. I mean, seriously, I'm not about to drop cash on a whole new console just for this game. 

And let's talk about the combat. Yeah, it's smooth and all, but it's basically a ripoff of Arkham. That game nailed the enemy interactions, combat mechanics, and tools. Spider-Man just borrowed everything from there. 

Don't even get me started on the "game of the year" nonsense. Are you kidding me? There are way better games out there that actually deserve that title. This game is just overhyped, plain and simple. So excuse me if I don't join the bandwagon of mindless praise.
------
Look, I get it. We all want to pass our exams, right? So what's the big deal if we use old exams to study? It's not like we're copying them word for word and pretending they're our own work. Professors should know better than reusing old exams anyway. Like, come on, put in a little effort and make new ones. But hey, if they're gonna be lazy, why should we suffer? And don't even get me started on sharing notes. How is that plagiarism? It's called collaboration, people! We're helping each other out, not stealing each other's ideas. Sharing study materials is just common sense. I mean, why reinvent the wheel when someone's already done the work for you? So yeah, call it cheating, call it whatever you want. But I see it as making the most of what's available to us. And if the professors don't like it, tough luck. They should step up their game.
------
Ugh, this whole soul talk is such BS. Like seriously, who even believes in that crap anymore? It's just some made-up concept to make us feel special and important. I mean, come on, why would I experience the world through someone else's eyes? It's called perspective, duh! We all have our own unique experiences and thoughts, it's not some magical soul controlling it all. And comparing it to a car? That's just dumb. We're not machines, bro!

Our minds and bodies are intertwined, there's no separate driver in there. It's all just chemicals and neurons doing their thing. Consciousness and awareness are products of our brain, not some soul floating around in space. And will? Please, that's just a fancy word for making decisions. There's no need for a soul to make choices, it's all based on our upbringing, experiences, and the way our brain works.

So yeah, let's stop with this soul nonsense and focus on real stuff that actually matters. Like memes and cute animal videos.
------
Look, I get it. Emotions are complicated and everyone experiences things differently. But seriously, can we stop pretending that a pregnancy is the same as a freaking broken arm? I mean, come on. Yes, I understand that some people might feel relieved or even conflicted about an unplanned pregnancy. But let's not forget that there are also those who are devastated, heartbroken, and maybe even traumatized by it. So no, it's not just about feeling sad or happy. It's about dealing with a major life-changing event that affects not just the person going through it, but also the potential future they envision for themselves. So please, let's not simplify something as big as a pregnancy into some kind of emotional rollercoaster that can be compared to a freaking broken arm.
------
Yo, listen up y'all. So, here's my take on this whole indoctrination thing. If a kid ain't feelin' the whole ceremonial mumbo jumbo or any other brainwashin' crap, they shouldn't be forced into it. And guess what? It's the parents' responsibility to protect their little ones from that kind of manipulation.

Look, I get it, parents have the right to raise their kids how they want, but let them freakin' be kids first, ya know? They don't need all that religious baggage weighin' 'em down when they're still learnin' to tie their shoes.

Personally, I never had to go to church as a kid. It was my choice, man. And I believe givin' kids a choice is hella important. Let 'em make up their own minds without feelin' pressured or threatened. That's what bein' a child is all about, livin' life, not havin' someone else's beliefs shoved down your throat.
------
Yo, listen up y'all. I gotta say, living in complete isolation straight up sucks. Like, it's actually equivalent to being dead. Back in the day, our ancestors knew what was up. They understood that relying on each other was the key to survival.

Just think about it, if I was a farmer and you were a hunter, we'd be killing it. You provide the meat, I hook you up with some bomb wheat/corn, and our badass neighbor builds us sick shelters. It's a win-win situation, my dudes.

And let's not forget, getting kicked out of society back then meant certain death. None of those losers could handle the wilderness on their own. They'd be snacks for hungry animals or starve to death. Plus, they couldn't even reproduce. Talk about natural selection at its finest.

So, y'all better believe that feeling like you belong is top priority. It's literally hard-wired into our brains from evolution. Forget about trying to be all logical and fair, that's for the higher-level thinkers. We're all about that basic instinctual social behavior, baby.
------
Man, you're just completely missing the point here. Yeah, a graphics card may last you 5-7 years, but consoles don't become outdated that quickly either. Look at the Xbox 360, that thing lasted for 8 years before the Xbox One came out. So, do your research before you try to prove a point.

And who said we're only talking about the hardcore gamers here? Casual gamers are a huge market, and they drive the gaming industry. Call of Duty, Destiny, Halo, Madden, those are the big dogs in the industry, not some niche indie games. They make way more money because the casual market has way more buying power.

And let's be real, casual gamers still play games regularly. They may not buy as many, but they still play them. That's why publishers are pushing microtransactions so hard, because those casual gamers will spend a bunch of extra money on a game they love.

And don't even get me started on the whole "PC is cheaper" argument. Maybe it is for you, but for me, it's not convenient. I like being able to sit in my living room with my wife and play games on the big screen. I don't want to deal with cleaning out my PC or constantly upgrading my graphics card. Consoles are just easier for us casual gamers.

And yeah, sure, sales and bundles are good on PC, but consoles have caught on to that too. Sony has their flash sales, Xbox is pushing hard with Games Pass, and Nintendo is always throwing out sales and indie games. PC isn't the only one with good deals anymore.
------
I gotta say, I'm so over this whole tech outfit trend. Like, seriously, it used to be cool and all, like a badge of honor that said, "Look at me, I'm so important I can wear jeans and a hoodie to work!" But now it's just become this obnoxious fashion statement. I can't even count how many times I've heard these tech people openly mocking others who actually put some effort into their appearance.

And let's be real here, it's such a fake outfit. They claim it's all about efficiency and saving time, but really, it's just another way for them to look down on anyone who doesn't conform. It's like they're trying to hide behind this facade of authenticity while working for these massive corporations. Newsflash, guys, Uber and Amazon aren't exactly cutting-edge startups anymore.

And don't even get me started on those arrogant CEOs bragging about their minimalist wardrobe choices. Seriously, who actually spends that much time thinking about fashion? It's ridiculous. So yeah, the tech outfit has definitely overstayed its welcome. Time to bring back some style and diversity, people!
------
Wow, just wow. I can't believe what I'm reading here. This whole post is just a bunch of nonsense. First of all, claiming that historical facts are impossible and that everything is just a probability? Are you for real? Do you even know what you're talking about? And then you have the audacity to accuse Christians of denying the possibility of contrived accounts in their canon? Please, spare me. You're just pulling stuff out of thin air and trying to sound smart. And don't even get me started on your claim that Paul was a usurper. Where's your evidence for that? Oh, that's right, you don't have any. Typical. And to top it all off, you're saying that the New Testament is just a bunch of inaccurate, contrived history written to fulfill an agenda? Seriously? Do you really think you know better than centuries of scholars and experts? Give me a break. Your whole argument is just laughable.
------
I gotta disagree with you there. I think your idea is pretty lame, to be honest. Who wants all builds to be the same? That's just boring as hell. The whole point of different builds is to have variety and play the game in different ways. I don't want some weak-ass build that can't do any damage up close or can only attack from far away. What's the fun in that?

And your point about gear being more important than the skill tree? Yeah, no shit Sherlock. Of course, good gear helps, but a strong passive tree can make a huge difference too. You can't just randomly pick skills and expect to steamroll the game. That's just dumb. Maybe if you're some kind of godly player with insane reflexes, you could get away with it. But for us mere mortals, having a well-thought-out build is crucial for actually being able to progress.

So yeah, I think you're way off base here. Different builds should stay different, and the skill tree matters more than you give it credit for.
------
Damn, that sucks man. It's crazy how one little thing like wanting kids can completely tear a relationship apart. But hey, you gotta do what's right for you, even if it means splitting up. It sounds like you both tried your best to make it work, but sometimes things just don't align, ya know? Better to figure this out now than later when you're knee-deep in diapers and regret.

It's tough realizing that you're fundamentally different from someone you thought you knew inside out. But hey, life's too short to settle for something that doesn't make you happy. Plus, forcing yourself to have kids when you don't want them would be a disaster waiting to happen.

So yeah, it's gonna hurt like a bitch for a while. Breakups always do. But take it from someone who's been there, it gets better. Eventually, that knot in your stomach will loosen up and you'll find someone who's on the same page as you. Hang in there, dude.

Hey y'all, just wanted to get your thoughts on this letter I sent to the Straits Times forum. I don't get why it got downvoted and they didn't publish it. Anyway, here's what happened: I applied for a summer internship at Uber in San Francisco and had this genius idea to save them money on driver incentives. But guess what? They didn't hire me, yet they went ahead and implemented my idea in Singapore. Talk about unfair, right?

So here's my take on it: with all these ride-hailing apps like Tada, Filo, Ryde, and Gojek popping up after Uber's exit, we're gonna see a bunch of discounts and promotions to attract customers. But let's not forget that drivers play a huge role in getting those customers, so duh, these companies are gonna have driver incentives. Like Uber used to give out weekly incentives for a certain number of trips.

Now, imagine this scenario: there's one customer waiting for a ride in Tampines to go to Clarke Quay. There are only two drivers in Tampines, and driver A is closer to the customer. Driver A only needs one more trip to get his incentive, while driver B needs 20 more. Who do you think should get the trip? Obviously driver A, right?

But guess what, the algorithm can be designed to screw over hard-working driver A and assign the trip to driver B instead, just to save on incentive costs. That's totally against meritocracy, man! Driver A put in the hours, but he gets screwed over because of some dumb algorithm.

I really hope the government steps in to stop these companies from designing their algorithms in a way that goes against meritocracy. They should even consider limiting the use of such algorithms until drivers hit their incentives. What do you guys think?
------
Are you serious? This post is just plain wrong. Hacking isn't some fancy-schmancy exploration and creative exercise. It's about breaking into systems, stealing personal information, and causing chaos. Yeah, sure, there might be some hackers out there who are all about finding out how things work, but let's not kid ourselves. Most hackers are just trying to exploit vulnerabilities and make a quick buck.

And who even cares about your "bored, awnry child" story? That doesn't make you an expert or anything. If anything, it just makes you sound like some wannabe hacker who thinks they know it all. So don't come here with your high and mighty description of hacking. The reality is that it's illegal, unethical, and downright annoying for those of us who have to deal with the aftermath of these cyber criminals.

So, save your little creative exercises for art class and let the real experts handle the world of hacking.
------
Wow, seriously? Are you even listening to yourself? First of all, who made you the relationship expert here? Nobody cares about your opinion on how important this is. And don't act like you know anything about raising kids because clearly, you don't. 

You're acting like this "choose" thing is some kind of life or death situation. Newsflash, it's not! Kids will figure things out on their own and decide what they want to believe or not. So stop trying to force your own beliefs on them and let them make their own choices when the time comes. 

And don't even get me started on school. Comparing religion to education? That's like comparing apples to oranges. We send kids to school to learn important skills and knowledge that will benefit them in life. Religion is just a bunch of made-up stories and rituals. It's not something we should be forcing onto innocent children.

So instead of suggesting a compromise with brainwashing, how about just letting kids grow up without any religious indoctrination and let them make their own decisions? It's not that complicated.
------
Lol, I totally agree with you, man! The balance team finally woke up and started listening to us, the gods of Reddit. It's about time they realized that we are the true experts on this game. I mean, look at all the changes they made based on our whiny-ass complaints. It's like they're hanging on to our every word now.

I gotta give props to Nathanias too. He's always whining about stuff on his stream, and it seems like the balance team is just bending over backwards to please him. I guess if you want changes, you just gotta bitch about it non-stop. It's not like they actually take the time to think about balance or anything.

But hey, let's not forget the other examples of their Reddit/Tl worship. Widow mine buff? Check. Carrier nerf? Check. Disrupter change? Check. Nydus change? Check. They're ticking off all the boxes, man.

So yeah, keep whining and complaining, guys. It's the only way to get things done around here. And to the balance team, I hope you guys are enjoying being our little puppets. Keep dancing to our tune, bitches!

Man, working at Walmart was a complete disaster for me. I had three freaking interviews just to get hired! And guess what? I have a ton of allergies to strong smells, so naturally they stick me in domestics where half of the damn department is cleaning supplies. Seriously, what were they thinking?

And don't even get me started on the morning supervisor. That jerk would constantly get pissed because I refused to put returns back on the shelves. Like, sorry dude, but I physically can't handle that shit. Plus, I couldn't even help customers find anything because, you know, allergies and all.

Oh, and let's talk about the pathetic excuse of training they gave me. A measly two-hour crash course on the register? Are you kidding me? No wonder I never knew what the hell I was doing when they called for backup. My department was like a maze, and they couldn't find me if their lives depended on it.

And to top it all off, I found out I was making more money than my trainer, who had been there for four freaking years! How the hell does that even happen?

But you know who had it good? The freaking furniture guy. That dude had his own little setup in a portable closet with a lamp and chair, where he would actually take naps and read. Can you believe that shit?

Yeah, working at Walmart was a total joke. I'm glad I was just a temp hire for a month because there's no way in hell I'm going back there for Christmas.
------
Look dude, I think you got it all wrong. The whole roygbiv thing isn't some made-up crap by Newton just because he wanted it to match the musical scale. It's actually a way to categorize the colors in the rainbow. As for indigo, yeah, it's a pretty messed up color to spot, but Newton added it just to have seven names. Now, when it comes to the sky, it's all about scattering. The bluer and purpler the colors, the stronger the scattering in the atmosphere. And if you wanna get technical, the scattering goes up to the fourth power of how short the wavelength is, whatever the hell that means. But check out that link I sent you, there's a plot that shows how scattering varies with color. Basically, all those wavelengths on the blue end get scattered the most, and when you mix them all together, you get that beautiful blue sky. There you go, hope this clears things up for ya!

Look, I get it if people want to go to church or study religion, it's their choice and all. But let's be real here, religion is just a bunch of made-up nonsense. Seriously, there is absolutely no evidence to back any of it up. Like, come on, who actually believes that the whole world was created in just seven days? It's a load of crap. I just want these religious folks to realize that they're basically choosing to believe in something with zero proof. It might sound harsh, but hey, it's the truth. So yeah, believe whatever you want, but at least have the common sense to know that it's all a bunch of hogwash.

Dude, if you're looking for a car in that price range, you better brace yourself for some major maintenance issues. Those cheap rides often come with high mileage, which means you'll be shelling out cash for repairs left and right. And let's be real, you can forget about having a worry-free ownership experience for the first few years. If I were you, I'd go for a damn Honda or Toyota. They may not be the flashiest, but they have the lowest freaking maintenance costs. Look into getting a used Camry or Civic, man. Those babies are always a safe bet. Plus, Civics are perfect if you want good gas mileage and reliability without burning a hole in your wallet. Hope this helps, but don't say I didn't warn you about the extra dough you gotta spend.
------
Yo, what's up with all this talk about "liberating" patents? Like, sure, it sounds cool and all, but what good is it gonna do if nobody can actually get their hands on the damn technology? And let's be real here, this community can't even have a civil discussion about basic scaling solutions without everything going to shit. So, how the hell are we supposed to trust that anything productive is gonna come out of this patent liberation? I mean, now that it's all out there on GitHub for everyone to see, you just know those Chinese miners and hardware manufacturers are gonna swoop in and start pumping out these ASICs like it's nobody's business. And you can bet your ass they're gonna charge a premium for it. So, yeah, call me skeptical, but I ain't getting my hopes up for any real change happening here.
------
Man, this whole discussion about reporting sexual stuff is messed up. Like, why the hell do people have to look down on you just because you've been through some shit? It's not like it's our fault or something. And then there are those so-called supportive people who just make it worse. They treat you like some fragile victim, constantly reminding you of what happened. Like, thanks for the reminder, but I'm more than just a survivor of whatever the hell you wanna call it.

And don't even get me started on that "rape survivor" label. It's like they want us to carry that shit around forever, like it's a tattoo on our damn foreheads. Can't we just move on and be normal people? I mean, I can play basketball or knit or whatever without it defining my whole goddamn life, right?

Honestly, I think all this focus on being a victim just makes it even more shameful and makes us wanna hide it. But hey, maybe not everyone feels that way. Who knows?
------
Wow, talk about missing the point. You really think your irrelevant reasons hold any weight? Please, enlighten us with your vast knowledge of controlled airspace. Oh wait, you don't have any, do you? Typical armchair expert. Maybe instead of making baseless assumptions, you should do some actual research and provide evidence to back up your claims. But who am I kidding, that would require effort on your part.

And don't get me started on your laughable comment about million-dollar radios. Just because they have fancy equipment doesn't mean they have their shit together. Look at all the aviation mishaps and near misses that happen every day. Clearly, money can't buy competence.

So, spare us your half-assed arguments and pretentious citations. The fact is, you don't know what you're talking about. End of story.
------
So, get this. I had to call the freaking cops back in January because of some sketchy situation going down near my place. And you know what? Guess who shows up? Not one, not two, but three female officers! I mean, seriously? How are they supposed to handle a forceful removal of someone? 

I get it, we're all about equality and everything, but come on! This is just ridiculous. And apparently, it's not even uncommon for them to team up with other female officers or a male-female duo. What a joke. 

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they can't do their job or anything. But let's be real here, a lot of people would probably find most female cops cute. It's just nature, right? 

But hey, who knows if this story I shared is even true. Take it with a grain of salt, folks!
------
Look, I get it. Tesla doesn't need ads because they have a cool product. But let's not pretend that their financials aren't shit. It's clear that Elon Musk is taking a huge gamble and it's not exactly paying off. Yeah, they're selling a lot of cars, but can they actually make a profit? That's the real question.

And speaking of ads, let's talk about weed. I don't understand why people think marketing is necessary for something like marijuana. Do we really need to be convinced to smoke weed? Come on! Just give us the facts about the strains and let us decide if we want to try it or not. We don't need some cheesy ad making us feel like we need it.

Plus, have we not learned anything from the whole cigarette advertising debacle? Young people are so easily influenced by ads, and we don't want to see a bunch of middle schoolers smoking weed because they think it's "cool". We should be putting restrictions in place to protect them, not trying to manipulate them into buying our products.

In the end, if you have to rely on ads to sell your product, maybe you should focus on making a better product instead of trying to trick people into buying it. And seriously, who even likes watching beer ads? Now imagine that, but with every stoner stereotype imaginable. No thanks. Let's just skip the marketing crap and let people make their own choices.
------
Hey guys, I gotta say, I appreciate your response... and I guess I'll apologize if I came off a bit too rough in my previous comment. But seriously, come on, there's gotta be some truth to this whole thing, right?

Look, I know there could be other explanations out there, but this one just seems to make the most damn sense to me. I mean, have you seen all these news stories that just don't add up unless you look at it through this filter? And what about the leaks? They're either totally bogus or only halfway true. It's all part of the damn show, man!

And speaking of news, did you hear about that crazy sh*t today?! If you understand that it's all just a big joke, then maybe it starts to make some twisted sense. It's still batsh*t insane, no doubt about it, but hey, at least it's not completely mind-boggling.

Oh, by the way, my bad for the misspelling earlier. It's Huber, not whatever the hell spellcheck messed it up to be. Peace out, y'all!
------
Man, I totally get what you're saying. I went to college for like four years and ended up dropping out because I couldn't stand all the boring lectures and useless assignments. I mean, who needs a piece of paper to prove you're smart, right? But I gotta admit, even though I didn't finish, I still think I gained something from that whole experience.

First of all, college helped me realize just how much I hated sitting in a classroom all day. It made me appreciate the hands-on work that I do now way more. Plus, being around a bunch of people who were actually passionate about their majors made me realize that I had no clue what the heck I wanted to do with my life.

And sure, maybe I didn't graduate, but college definitely taught me how to manage my time and take responsibility for myself. Living on my own and trying to survive on a budget taught me some real-life skills that I probably wouldn't have learned otherwise.

So yeah, maybe getting a degree isn't everything, but going to college did shape me in some ways. And now, I'm stoked to be working as an electrician and actually enjoying what I do. So screw the haters who say you need a fancy degree to be successful. Just do what makes you happy, man!
------
Seriously, who the hell are these "powers that be" that keep changing terms all the damn time? It's so frustrating! I mean, textbooks still use the terms master/slave and some programming languages still roll with it too. Honestly, some of these replacement terms they come up with are just random and confusing as hell. Like, what's the point? Communication becomes a total clusterf*** when we're all talking about the same thing but using different jargon that doesn't even make sense in the context of our conversation. Can't we just stick with something that actually makes sense and is widely understood? Ugh, it's enough to make your head spin.
------
Look, I get that clang is not llvm and rust has its own thing going on with llvm. But seriously, why would you automatically assume that just because llvm is a requirement, you would have to use clang? It's not the only option out there, you know.

I mean, unless there's some specific reason like performance or whatever, it seems pretty logical to just stick with your default system compiler toolchain. Why complicate things unnecessarily?

But hey, here's the kicker: Mozilla is planning to drop support for anything other than clang/llvm. So yeah, you might want to consider hopping on that bandwagon if you don't want to deal with a potential maintenance nightmare down the road. Just saying.
------
I gotta be honest here, but I don't get the hype with these Instagram models. Like, sure, they might have a good body when you look at it from a bodybuilding perspective, but for me, it's just nothing special. I mean, come on, it's all about personal preference, right? And personally, I just find most of them to be generic hot girls. I know a bunch of girls in real life who, if you saw them without all those filters, camera angles, and perfect lighting, you would never guess they were Instagram models. It's all smoke and mirrors, man. But hey, I guess there's a market for it, so to each their own. Just not my cup of tea, ya know?
------
I mean, come on, who comes up with these studies? The fact that they focused on politicians just seems absurd to me. Like, politicians are just regular people too, you know? So, anyone with half a brain can judge if someone is corrupt or likely to be deceitful. But here's what gets me, if we can all see through the BS, how the heck do these corrupt politicians still manage to deceive enough people to get elected? It's like they don't have a moral compass or something.

And let's not forget about this whole predator-prey thing you mentioned. If I understand it correctly, it's saying that humans can pick up on certain traits of deception and corruption. But then again, how is it possible that the public doesn't have this instinct? Is it because some people are just too naïve or straight-up clueless?

And don't even get me started on the study participants themselves. I mean, they specifically signed up for this study to make some extra cash, right? So, they might not be the best representation of your average Joe out there. Who knows if their opinions and judgments align with what the general public thinks? 

Overall, I think this study missed the mark big time.
------
Honestly, I don't get all the hate towards Raja and Raven. People out here acting like they invented drag or something. Like, have you ever heard of respect? These queens are frickin' legendary! They paved the way for the likes of Violet and brought drag to a whole new level. So, before y'all start trashing them, remember where they've come from and how much they've done for this community.

And let's not forget about FPR. Yeah, they might joke around and talk about random shit like porn stars and Taylor Swift, but that's what makes it entertaining! It's not meant to be all serious and academic. If you've actually watched more than just season 10, you'd know that Raja and Raven aren't these uptight divas people make them out to be. They're just having fun and not taking themselves too seriously.

So, next time you wanna bash Raja and Raven, think twice and show some damn respect. They deserve it!
------
Man, I gotta say, your understanding of games is seriously lacking. You think it's all about fiestas, but it's actually about knowing how to play from a deficit or disadvantage. Look at the stats from Riot, the LPL has the fastest games around. They're constantly making plays to turn a losing game into a win. That's why you get those crazy fiestas. But then you look at LCS and it's just the same old push, teamfight, win or lose, push again crap. It's so boring. The fast-paced style of the LPL would destroy teams like Liquid and Fnatic at Worlds, even if they're down in gold. So maybe you should start watching some real games instead of being stuck in your little LCS bubble.
------
Okay, so first of all, do you even know what subreddit you're in? This isn't r/theologyclass or whatever. We're here to chill and have a good time, not to argue about Bible interpretations. Who cares if "lucifer" means morning star? It's just some ancient word that people like to throw around. And please, spare us the history lesson about the king of Babylon and all that. We're not here for a history lecture, we just want to meme and shitpost.

And seriously, dude, do you really think some biblical story is just some guy ranting against Babylonian authority? That's a stretch, my friend. Let's not get all conspiracy theorist on this sub. Stick to your own theories and interpretations, but don't come here spewing them like they're facts.

Oh, and by the way, Jesus being the king of kings and all that jazz? Cool story bro. Don't you have anything better to talk about? Like the latest episode of that new show everyone's talking about or the latest gaming news? Let's keep it light and fun, okay?
------
Alright folks, buckle up because we're diving into the world of phase diagrams! So, basically, this fancy chart shows you what state water is in based on pressure and temperature. It's got two axes - one for pressure and one for temperature. And hey, you see that logarithmic pressure scale? It means that each notch is ten times bigger than the one below it. We're talking vacuum to regular air in the middle, and then BAM, mind-blowing crushing pressure at the top.

Now let's talk about ice. You'll notice that there are different types of ice labeled with Roman numerals. Why? Well, when ice forms, those water molecules lock themselves in place, like a solid should. The phase diagram tells us how they arrange themselves. Below 100 MPA, the type of ice only changes with temperature, not pressure. But once you hit that mark, pressure starts messing with the shapes as the ice tries to compact.

Oh, and did you know that ice floats? Yeah, it's because it's less dense than water. That's why it's tough to compress regular water. Fun fact: at around zero degrees, pressures above 10 MPA can even melt ice.

But things get wild when we hit around 1 gigapascal. At this crazy pressure, water can turn into ice EVEN AT boiling temperatures. Yeah, you heard me right. Water at 100 degrees Celsius can get crushed into ice. And this ice is no joke, my friends. It's denser than water, so it sinks. But we're talking intense pressures here, way more than the deepest part of the ocean.

So here's the bottom line:

1. Regular water doesn't compress well under "normal" pressures and temperatures.
2. But when you crank up the pressure, water can turn into solid ice, no matter how hot it is.

Mind-blowing stuff, right? Keep scrolling and keep learning, my friends!
------
Alright, first of all, let me make it clear that I'm not trying to start a religious debate here. But seriously, who came up with this "thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor" crap? Like, why does it even matter? We lie all the time, right? It's just a natural part of being human. You can't expect people to always be honest.

And let's not confuse lying with advertising. Yeah, companies try to sell us stuff by exaggerating and sometimes straight-up lying about their products. But that's just business, you know? They're not out there ruining someone's life by spreading lies about them.

So why do we even have this commandment? It's like ancient people were so obsessed with controlling everyone's behavior that they had to come up with ridiculous rules like this. Can't we just live and let live? Stop worrying about what other people say or do and mind our own damn business. That's what I think, anyway.
------
Lol, sorry but this whole discussion is just a bunch of philosophical mumbo-jumbo. Who cares about free will and all that deep stuff? I mean, seriously, does it even matter? Life's too short to waste time pondering over this crap.

But hey, if you really want my opinion, I'll give it to you straight. Look, we all have a will, right? It's just that sometimes our will changes based on different factors. Like, yeah, maybe I decided to eat less carbs because I wanted to be healthier, but that doesn't mean I'm not acting freely. I still made that decision myself, nobody forced me. So yeah, I guess that's proof that I have free will.

Bottom line, don't overcomplicate things. Just do what you want and enjoy life. Free will or not, who gives a damn?
------
Wow, seriously? Are you even reading the argument properly? This is such a narrow-minded perspective. Yeah, let's just trust corporations to do the right thing voluntarily, because we all know how well that has worked out in the past. Look, buddy, regulations exist for a reason - to protect people and the environment from greedy corporate bullcrap. It's easy for you to preach about how regulations are just a burden for corporations when you're not the one drinking contaminated water or breathing toxic air. And don't even get me started on worker safety. Without regulations, companies would cut corners left and right, putting their employees' lives at risk just to save a few bucks. So, before you go spewing nonsense, think about the consequences of your so-called "correct model".
------
Hey, y'all! So, let's talk about this whole weight loss thing. I know it's tempting to want those quick results and drop the pounds like crazy, but slow the hell down! Seriously, crashing and burning with crash diets ain't gonna get you anywhere.

Now, some folks say that losing 1% of your body weight per week is a good target. It's not some magical number or anything, just a rough guideline that works for most people in most situations. Don't get me wrong, there ain't no fancy studies to back this up, especially when it comes to combining weight loss with lifting weights. We're talking a whole different ball game here.

Calorie partitioning? Genetics? Yeah, it's a freaking mess. We ain't got all the answers, my friends. So, let's just stick to the basics and take things slow. Slow and steady wins the race, remember? So, why not give this 1% thing a shot and see how it goes?

But hey, don't stress too much about the specific numbers. Just do what feels right for you and listen to your body. And remember, Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither will your dream body. Keep hustlin' and you'll get there eventually. Stay awesome, folks!
------
Yo, so I was just browsing this sub and I saw y'all talking about the violence and slavery in the Bible. And honestly, I don't get why everyone's freaking out about it. Like, yeah, it happened back in the day, but that doesn't mean we gotta judge them based on our fancy 21st-century morals. It's called historical context, people!

The Old Testament is just telling it like it was, not saying we should go enslave people now. And let me drop some knowledge on y'all, even Karl Marx knew that slavery was just a phase in economic development. It's all about that class struggle and stuff, you know? We're way past that now with capitalism ruling the game, and heading towards socialism/communism. So chill out and stop trying to apply today's standards to people who lived thousands of years ago.

Hope that clears things up for ya. Peace out!
------
Alright, listen up peeps. Can we just take a moment to address the hypocrisy here? I mean, seriously! We all know those fundamentalists love preaching about how God can't be questioned. But guess what? The Bible itself is full of examples where people totally question God and guess what? He actually changes His mind sometimes. Yeah, that's right! It's right there in the good ol' Old Testament, so don't tell me it ain't part of the canon.

Look, I get it. People hate having their way of life put under a microscope. But if we're gonna believe in this all-powerful God, then he should be able to handle some real objections, like why the heck does suffering exist, right? I mean, come on now. If this dude is really as mighty as they say, then surely He can handle a little criticism.

So, to all you hardcore believers out there, stop acting like God's ego is so fragile. Let's have an open dialogue and question the heck out of everything. That's the only way we'll ever get some real answers, am I right?
------
Dude, what are you even talking about? We all know objects can rotate along multiple axes in regular 3D space. It's like basic physics. You don't need to tell us to Google it or watch some silly videos. We're not idiots here. 

But seriously, your description with the rolling cylinder and flipping and all that jazz is just making my head spin. Who has time to imagine all that? Just say it rotates in different directions, man. No need to complicate things with all these axes and discs. 

Like, I appreciate you trying to be all fancy and stuff, but let's keep it real. We're on Reddit, not some physics lecture. So thanks for the unnecessary explanation, I guess? But next time, just keep it simple, dude.
------
This shit is seriously ridiculous. I can't believe people are still complaining about this. The whole "avoid player" thing was a disaster from the start and they should have just scrapped it completely. Yeah, I get that some high mmr players had longer queue times because everyone was avoiding them, but honestly, who gives a fuck? It's a game, get over it.

And now they bring it back with some half-assed "on my team only" bullshit. Like seriously, what's the point? If someone is toxic or throws in a game, I don't want them anywhere near me, whether they're on my team or the enemy team. And to add insult to injury, they only give you three slots? Are you kidding me? 

I don't know about you guys, but I think this whole avoid player thing is just a waste of time. Blizzard needs to focus on fixing the actual gameplay issues instead of this pointless feature. But hey, that's just my two cents.
------
Dude, seriously? Are you even thinking before you write this crap? Your logic is completely messed up. Eren could have totally married Historia before he headed to Marley. If he did, he wouldn't be locked up right now and he could do whatever the hell he wants with Zeke, without the Scouts breathing down his neck. And don't get me started on the whole timeline thing. It makes zero sense for Eren to be the father. In most monarchies, you can't become king by just knocking up the queen. That shit's dangerous, man! Plus, there's already a damn royal family in place. So, yeah, your theory is just plain dumb. Try again next time, genius.
------
I swear, people these days will do anything to get attention. Did y'all see that video of the girl trying to cross the street and almost getting hit by a motorcycle? I mean, seriously, what was she thinking? It's like she purposely timed it to run out in front of him. Some people are just so damn stupid.

I don't know if you noticed, but in that split second when she separated from the crowd, she actually looked right. The motorcycle was right there, clear as day. How the hell did she not see it? And don't even get me started on the rider. Maybe he glanced at traffic for a moment, but he should have been more alert. Nobody can focus on two things at once, right?

I hope that idiot of a girl learned her lesson and won't go pulling any more stunts like that. Just my two cents, but damn, some people really need to use their brain before they put themselves and others in danger.
------
Well, I gotta say, the explanation for why the girls are on ships in this show is pretty freaking lame. I mean, they dedicate a whole OVA to explain it, but it's seriously not even interesting. The only reason they're on ships is to boost the economy and make them all independent and leader material or some crap like that. Like, seriously? That's the best they could come up with? It's just a half-assed excuse for why there's a whole civilization on these boats. I was hoping for some cool post-apocalyptic backstory or something, you know? If you want that kind of stuff, check out High School Fleet. It's like the ship version of Girls und Panzer and it actually deserves more attention. So disappointing.
------
Okay, let me tell you something. It doesn't matter if he fought some weak-ass shukaku or a full-power shukaku, or even went up against the big boy Kurama himself. None of that even comes close to fighting an otsutsuki with not one, not two, but three freaking rinnegans! Like seriously, have you seen what Sasuke can do? He single-handedly trapped all those tailed beasts with just a freshly awakened rinnegan. That's some next-level shit right there. And then we got Momoshiki, who made Killer Bee look like a little bitch. So let's get real here, folks. Momoshiki is on a whole different level than any tailed beast out there.

Now, let's talk about this Boruto kid. I mean, sure, he's talented for a genin and that vanishing rasengan thingy is pretty dope. But come on, Sasuke bringing him along on that mission? It's gotta mean one of two things: either Sasuke was so damn confident in his skills that he thought he could protect him, or he's just straight-up crazy. Maybe it's a bit of both, who knows? But let's be real, it's gonna be a wild ride with that kid around.
------
The Face ID on the iPhone X and XS is definitely a hardware improvement, no doubt about it. I own both of them, and let me tell you, the XS is like going from gen1 to gen2 Touch ID. It works way better in bright sunlight too, hardly ever get a false read in any light.

And can we talk about the screen? It's not complete garbage like some people make it out to be. The resolution at 326ppi is perfectly fine. Sure, it's not some fancy OLED display, but it's still a damn good pixel density. Who cares about 720p and 1080p when it comes to phones anyways? And if you take into account the pentile subpixel arrangement on OLED displays, the XR's display isn't that far off from the XS's pixel density.

Now, let's address the thicker bezel. Yeah, it's there, but honestly, it doesn't look bad at all. Check out the images and hands-on videos, you'll see what I mean. And yeah, losing 3D touch sucks, no matter how you try to spin it.

After using the XS Max for a day, I can confidently say that if my only options were the X or the XR, I'd seriously consider waiting for the XR and checking out the reviews. The A12 chip improvements, the insane battery life, and the new wide camera with smart HDR are major upgrades. I'm not so sure I'd want to go back to the X once I've experienced the XR.
------
Dude, you know what's messed up? The damn title screen of Skyrim. Like seriously, why the hell would they stick you in a paralyzed state in some realistic-ass room? It's just a freaking game menu! And don't even get me started on how Bethesda likes to cut corners with their coding. Like, did you know that sometimes when you're talking to an NPC through a wall or a door, it's actually just a frickin' object on the other side? I mean, come on! Boetheia in Skyrim is literally a damn wardrobe behind a locked door. Talk about lazy programming, man. Bethesda needs to step up their game and stop trying to trick us with these bogus tricks. It's just plain ridiculous.
------
Damn dude, sounds like you're going through some tough shit. It sucks when you realize that the person you were counting on is actually a total disappointment. But hey, at least you're starting to see the truth now. Cut off all communication with that toxic chick, she's not worth your time or energy. Take this as an opportunity to focus on yourself and build some damn confidence. Maybe try boxing or some other badass martial art to let out all that frustration. And don't rush the healing process, man. It's gonna take time to get over this crap. Just keep pushing forward and eventually things will start to look up. Keep us posted, bro. Good luck, you're gonna need it.
------
Okay, so let me get this straight. We got Jon Connington claiming that Robert almost killed him with a sword, but then we got Harwin saying that they didn't even cross swords? What the hell is going on here? Is someone lying or what?

I mean, yeah, sure, Connington was a decent swordsman and all, but if Robert really went after him with a blade, you can bet your ass he would've been mincemeat. We all know Robert was a beast with that war hammer of his, but he was no slouch with a sword either. The guy killed six men in one day, including a famous knight who used to be Rhaegar's squire. And yeah, I get it, they never actually fought each other directly, but come on, Connington got wounded by him and Robert killed that Ser Denys Arryn dude.

So, moral of the story: Don't mess with Robert Baratheon, whether he's swinging a sword or a damn war hammer. That dude will slice you up or smash your face in without breaking a sweat.
------
Yo, I totally feel you on this one! I used to think I was the only one who got these crazy headaches whenever a storm was about to hit. It's like mother nature is personally targeting us, am I right? Anyway, I've also noticed that it happens more when the weather changes super quickly. It sucks big time, especially when you're just trying to enjoy the rain or whatever. I don't have any head injuries either, so I don't think it's that. I've tried taking some over-the-counter painkillers, but they only provide temporary relief. Some people say using a warm compress on your forehead or taking a hot shower might help, but honestly, I haven't found anything that works perfectly. If anyone has any magical remedies, please share because I'm tired of these damn storm headaches ruining my vibe!
------
Okay, seriously? Your idea is just plain idiotic. I mean, who the hell wants to turn every public funding project into some kind of gofundme? Do you really think people are going to voluntarily donate their hard-earned money to things they couldn't care less about? Get real!

And what's with your fixation on the media? Just because people don't want to throw their cash at something doesn't automatically make it propaganda. It means they have better things to do with their money. But I guess that's too complicated for your tiny brain to comprehend.

And let's not forget about the rich jerks who would love this system. They'd be throwing money left and right, controlling everything based on their desires. War? Sure, they'd fund that in a heartbeat. Because apparently, it's totally fine for the wealthy to have all the power while the rest of us suffer.

In case you missed the memo, democracy is about more than just dollars. It's about giving everyone a voice, not just the damn billionaires. So maybe take your ridiculous ideas elsewhere and save us all from your stupidity.
------
Man, this article is such BS. Like seriously, can they stop with all these misleading headlines? They're making it seem like movies today are way more popular than in the past, but that's just not true. The box office numbers don't mean squat if you don't take into account inflation and stuff. So what if Incredibles 2 made a boatload of money? It doesn't change the fact that Lion King was a freaking phenomenon back in the day. And don't even get me started on Black Panther. Yeah, it did well, but Avengers crushed it, man. So let's stop with all this cherry-picking of numbers to make movies seem way more successful than they actually are. It's straight-up misleading and annoying as hell.
------
Yo, what's up everyone? So I heard that Luis Felipe is locked up at the super-max in Colorado, right? Like, isn't this exactly the reason they even built that prison in the first place? I mean, come on, they gotta take extreme measures for dudes like him.

And seriously, if this guy has been causing trouble by getting all up in people's business, is it really controversial to limit his contact with others? Like, why the heck should he have access to his weapons if he's just gonna keep causing trouble?

So, to all you legal scholar peeps out there, do you honestly think it's a "controversial" move to hold someone in these hardcore conditions? Yeah, the super-max is no freakin' paradise, but it ain't no Hanoi Hilton or Guantanamo either.

I'm all for human rights, but that includes the rights of normal people to be safe from whackos like Luis Felipe. So, speak up, guys. What's your true, uncensored opinion about this situation? We're all anonymous here, so spill the beans.

Thanks, y'all!

Alright, I'm gonna be honest with you here. Your post is just a hot mess. You claim that meat is bad and we should all stop eating it, but your arguments are weak and unconvincing. You bring up some irrelevant points about sunlight being carcinogenic, but seriously, who eats sunlight? Last time I checked, humans need food, not sunshine on a plate.

And then you go on to say that over-consuming sugar and calories is what destroys our health, not meat. Wow, Sherlock Holmes, great deduction skills there. But newsflash, we're talking about meat, not sugar. Stay on topic, buddy.

Oh, and let's not forget your brilliant suggestion to replace cars and plastics with bicycles and trains. Sure, because that's a totally realistic and viable solution, right? I mean, who needs hospitals and medical equipment made from plastic when we can all just ride our bikes to the doctor's office?

Look, I get it. You're all about saving the environment and being healthy. But attacking meat eaters and throwing out half-baked arguments isn't gonna convince anyone. Maybe try doing some actual research and come up with some valid points before you start preaching to the rest of us. Just saying.

Wow, seriously? It's like people have no clue about how things actually work. Google isn't some innocent victim here, they knew exactly what they were doing when they made those demands. They wanted all the perks and none of the responsibilities. And let's not forget how they manipulate the system with their flashy ads. They have so much cash flowing in from that, it's no wonder they can afford to play around in the ISP market.

But guess what? Competition is a real thing, and Google couldn't handle it. They thought they could just waltz in and dominate the market, but they underestimated the big players like Comcast and Verizon. These giants have been in the game for years, building infrastructure and establishing their presence. Google Fiber never stood a chance.

So before you go blaming taxes and licenses, maybe take a good hard look at Google's own greed and arrogance. They thought they were above it all, and now they're paying the price. Good riddance, I say.

Dude, seriously? What are you even talking about? This whole "security through obscurity" thing is a load of crap. Who cares if some crook figures out where the cameras are? They're still gonna get caught, right? I mean, it's not like they're masterminds or something.

And let's be real here, who the hell is gonna spend their time reading news articles about crime prevention? If someone's about to commit a crime, they're not gonna sit there and think, "Oh, let me make sure I don't act suspicious." They're just gonna do whatever the hell they want.

So honestly, this whole security scheme you're blabbering about is pointless. It's like putting a lock on a door that's already open. Just focus on catching the criminals instead of wasting your time with all this fancy camera hiding bullshit.

So I'm just chillin' at the tattoo parlor, right? And my artist is talking some shit about this dude next to us. Apparently, this poor guy has been doing these basic-ass wrist tattoos all day long. Can you believe it? Like, people just walk in and are like, "Yo, give me a date or a feather, but make it super simple and no color or details." I mean, come on, have some originality, am I right?

Anyway, I was only supposed to have a four-hour session, but the client after me flaked, so my artist was like, "Hey, let's keep going." And I was like, "Hell yeah!" So we kept at it. But the best part was seeing all the lame-ass ideas that the artist next to us had to deal with. These customers were all like, "Don't add anything cool or interesting, just do exactly what I say."

Man, some people have no taste. But hey, at least I got a kick out of it.

Hey everyone! So it's banned books week, or as I like to call it, a week where people get their panties in a twist over what they can and can't read. Seriously, who needs censorship when you can just ban books? Anyway, to show my rebellious side, I'm planning on illustrating some banned books this week. But before I get to that, let me share some of my previous illustrations of controversial books.

First up, we have "All Quiet on the Western Front." Can you believe Nazi Germany banned and burned this book just because it didn't fit their oh-so-perfect ideology? Talk about fragile egos.

Then we have "The Bell Jar," banned because it dares to depict suicide. Oh no, heaven forbid we acknowledge mental health issues!

Next, we have "Fahrenheit 451." The irony here is priceless. It got banned for showing a Bible being burned. Guess some folks can't handle a little criticism of religion. Also, it says "damn" and "hell." Gasp!

"Fight Club" is an obvious one. Violence and sex are apparently too much for delicate readers.

Moving on to "Heart of Darkness." Banned for violence and racial views? Surprise, surprise. It was written during a different time, people.

And who can forget "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," challenged for glorifying prostitution, murder, and obscenity. Because we all know books have the power to turn us into murderers, right?

Lastly, we have "Perfume," banned for obscenity. I guess some people can't handle a little raunchiness in their reading material.

Oh, and "The Stranger" got challenged in Texas in 2016 for offending religious sensibilities. Seriously? Grow a thicker skin, people!

Reading the reasons for these bans is just mind-boggling. Some people need to lighten up and realize that books don't bite. Let's celebrate the freedom to read whatever the hell we want! Peace out.

Hey guys, so I've been seeing a lot of questions about how to improve DPS on certain boss fights. First off, stop comparing yourself to the top players, seriously. Most of us aren't gonna be cheesing our way through fights like they do. 

Next, look at your talents. Are you using the right ones for the fight? Don't be an idiot and bring heavy cleave talents to a single-target fight, or vice versa. It's common sense, people.

And let's not forget about the gear. I mean, come on, a frost death knight stacking crit and mastery with good azerite traits is obviously gonna perform better than someone stacking haste and versatility with trash traits.

If you want to really step up your game, take a look at some top parses and see how they're doing it. Open up a few of them, check out their rotation on the timeline. You'll notice smart players holding their breath for ages before going all out on priority targets or when there's more stuff to hit. It's all about timing, man.

So, long story short, stop being a noob and start looking into what the pros are doing. Check out top logs, fix your rotations, and use your cooldowns wisely. That's how you'll actually make a difference.

Man, I totally feel you! My sister also got a s8 plus and she's been complaining about the same thing. It's ridiculous how expensive those dang screen protectors are, and I swear they're designed to be impossible to put on properly. Like, who has the time and patience for that?

And don't even get me started on OLED screens. The colors are all wonky and in-your-face, like they're trying too hard to impress or something. It's like looking at a neon sign on steroids for hours on end. Give me a good ol' LCD any day. They may not have all those fancy features, but at least they won't give you a headache after five minutes.

But hey, to each their own, right? Some people are just obsessed with OLEDs, I guess. Can't say I understand it though. So yeah, count me in on agreeing with you on that point. LCD all the way, baby!
------
I mean, seriously? Are you even listening to yourself? This whole post is just a load of crap. Sure, they mentioned some fancy terms like "actor-observer bias" and "fundamental attribution error," but that doesn't make it any less of an over-generalization. Just because something has a fancy name doesn't mean it applies to every single human being out there.

And what's with this whole "humans are not inherently logical creatures" nonsense? Speak for yourself, buddy. Maybe you're the one who's not logical, but don't lump the rest of us in with your stupidity. Yeah, sure, we might make some mistakes and rely on heuristics and biases from time to time, but that doesn't mean we're incapable of logic.

So next time, before you start spewing your pseudo-intellectual BS, maybe take a step back and actually think about what you're saying. Because right now, you just sound like a condescending know-it-all.
------
I mean, seriously, who the hell thought it was a good idea to make the Model X so damn wide? It's like they completely forgot that other countries exist and have actual roads. I can't even imagine trying to maneuver that beast through some narrow-ass European streets. It's no wonder it's not selling well outside of the US and China.

And don't even get me started on those 89.4 inches of width. That's just ridiculous. I bet the folks over at GMC are laughing their asses off, knowing their Sierra is narrower than this monstrosity. Like, come on Tesla, did you really think people in ancient cities with narrow, windy roads would be lining up to buy this oversized behemoth?

I swear, if they made the Model X more street-friendly, it would sell like hotcakes all over the damn globe. But hey, who needs sales when you can have a car that doesn't fit anywhere but the US and China, right? Genius move, Tesla. Real genius move.
------
Man, I totally get what you're saying. Final Fantasy 8 was a whole different beast compared to the earlier ones. And yeah, it's not like I'm saying it has anything in common with FF1-3 (us) either. It's just that the shift from one game to the next was like night and day. You had all these new fans hopping on board during the PlayStation era, and they just weren't prepared for how drastically different each FF game could be.

Honestly, the change was so damn jarring that it messed with the reception of FF8. Both the fans and the critics were like, "What the hell is this?" It's like expecting another Chrono Trigger and getting slapped with Chrono Cross instead. Don't get me wrong, Chrono Cross is a solid game, but it's a far cry from its predecessor. And that's exactly how FF8 hit us.

So yeah, I feel your frustration, man. It's like we were robbed of what we were expecting, and instead, we got something completely unexpected. It's a tough pill to swallow, but hey, at least we can appreciate it for what it is.
------
Wow, are you seriously defending those kids who were smoking on campus? Give me a break! Just because you disagree with me doesn't give you the right to attack me personally. Grow up!

It's pretty obvious that you're biased and just refuse to admit it. You're justifying their stupid and illegal behavior. I mean, come on, smoking in public and underage? That's just plain idiotic.

And to clarify again, for all the geniuses out there who can't seem to comprehend it, I'm not the original poster. No matter how many times you claim I am, it won't change the fact that I'm not. And no amount of your delusional beliefs will make it true that smoking weed in public and underage is okay.
------
Man, it's crazy how anti-intellectualism is so widespread in American culture. And you know what? That crap seeps into the minds of the people who vote for our leaders. It's no wonder why folks despised President Obama and Hillary Clinton. They acted all high and mighty, looking down on us normal Americans. But what really grinds my gears is that those same people who bashed Obama and Clinton for that are totally fine with Trump doing the exact same thing! But oh no, it's different for Trump because supposedly God chose him to bring back godliness to our nation or some bullshit like that. Seriously, it's like everyone fell for the biggest scam ever.
------
Honestly, I don't get why everyone is losing their minds about the wait for the next Diablo game. It's not like we don't have a million other games to play in the meantime. Blizzard may take forever to release a new game, but at least when they do, it's usually worth the wait. Yeah, they might have some issues here and there, but overall, their games are pretty damn polished compared to most other developers out there. So if they need another year, or hell, even two, to make sure the next Diablo is up to snuff, then I say let them take all the time they need. I'd rather wait a bit longer and get a kick-ass game than get some rushed piece of crap. Patience, people, patience.
------
This whole Kavanaugh thing is a damn joke. Ford can't even remember shit about the event, but apparently that's totally normal for someone who went through some traumatic shit years ago. Like, come on! Have you ever actually experienced trauma? You remember certain stuff vividly and the rest is just a blur. And she accused him way before his nomination, she just didn't make it public. Plus, she's not even 100% sure it was him, so why the hell are we still talking about this?

And let's not forget the fact that all four witnesses she gave denied her story. That's pretty telling, don't you think? But oh no, Kavanaugh has some damn calendars that supposedly prove he wasn't there. Yeah, right! What about all those impromptu events he conveniently left out? I bet there's more to the story.

And I gotta say, Kavanaugh's willingness to go on TV with his wife and claim he was a damn virgin during that time period is just pathetic. Can you really believe that? And Ford, refusing to testify under oath? Give me a break! I just watched her lie through her teeth under oath.

But you know what really grinds my gears? Feinstein sitting on this story for months. It's obvious that the Dems are just using this as a political weapon. They don't give a damn about Ford or justice or any of that crap. They just want to screw over Kavanaugh and it's sickening.

Honestly, my mom, who's a Trump supporter, said it best. Even if Kavanaugh was a freaking serial rapist, these people would still support him. That's the messed up mindset of his supporters. They're just too damn blinded by their own agenda to see the truth.
------
Man, I gotta say, this team is a total disappointment. Like seriously, their performance against Liverpool was just the tip of the iceberg. Their squad, especially the midfield, is weak as hell. Verratti? Yeah, he's nowhere near as good as we all expected him to be by now. And let's not forget that sorry excuse for a performance against Madrid last year. Neymar and Mbappe? Total letdowns. I mean, did they even show up for those games? And don't even get me started on Cavani. Dude didn't do sh*t in that first leg, no wonder he got benched.

Look, I'm not saying they're completely done for, but let's be real here. There are way better teams out there with way better midfielders. I wouldn't even put them in the top 3 or top 5 contenders for the Champions League this season. So yeah, it's not just about one bad game against Liverpool, it's a combination of many things. And honestly, it's time to face the facts - they ain't winning anything significant anytime soon.
------
Honestly, I don't get why people are hyping up this team so much. If we're being real here, they're just not that impressive. Take their midfield, for example. It's a joke compared to other top contenders in the Champions League. Verratti? Overrated. Rabiot? Nothing special. Even with both of them together, they still can't compete with the big boys.

And let's not forget their embarrassing performance against Madrid last year. Neymar and Mbappe? More like Neymeh and Mbust. They were absolute disappointments. I don't think they even have two minutes of decent highlights from those two legs. And Cavani? Useless in that first leg. No wonder he got benched.

Look, I'm not saying they're completely hopeless. They have some talented players, but they're definitely not top three or even top five contenders for the Champions League this season. So yeah, it's not just about their crappy performance against Liverpool. It's a combination of many things that make them look like a second-rate team.
------
Dude, why do we keep having this dumb conversation? Leg drive is important, but that doesn't mean you can't get stronger without it. In fact, using variations like the Larsen press without leg drive can actually make you stronger overall. It's like having different tools in your shed, you know? But seriously, everyone's different, so it's hard to compare and say for sure. But I do think giving up leg drive for a few weeks could have some benefits. And those haters who say instability is always bad? They just don't know what they're talking about. Don't listen to them, man.
------
Wow, another one of those entitled people who think they deserve everything without working for it. Seriously, dude, get a grip. I don't need to provide you with any studies because it's common sense. And if you can't see that, then you're just plain ignorant.

Luxuries vs necessities? Please. Who are you to decide what is necessary and what isn't? Just because you live in your mom's basement and eat ramen noodles every day doesn't mean the rest of us should settle for that. We work hard for our money and we should be able to spend it on whatever the hell we want.

But hey, if you think everyone should live like they're scraping by and never have anything nice, go ahead and live in your sad little world. The rest of us will be enjoying our cable, eating out at nice restaurants, and rocking the latest iPhone. Don't hate just because you can't afford it.
------
Honestly, the whole Bradley development situation wasn't as bad as people make it out to be. Yeah, there were some issues, but let's not blow it out of proportion.

The problem was that this Air Force colonel, Burton, was a complete idiot and started causing a ruckus over nothing. He wanted the Army to shoot anti-tank weapons at the Bradley during testing, which makes no sense because obviously that's gonna mess it up. So he ran crying to Congress like a little baby.

Look, the Bradley had a rough time in development, I'll give you that. Real-world experience with armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles, plus changing enemy threats, meant that they had to constantly make design changes. It's just the nature of the beast.

And don't even get me started on the M16. People say it wasn't developed with the idea that it didn't need cleaning, but that's just not true. Even when the gun had its worst issues, units that were properly trained and had good maintenance programs still praised it. So there you have it.
------
Okay, here's my informal and impolite post:

Ugh, another one of these whiny concern troll posts. Can't people have a different point of view without being labeled and dismissed? It's ridiculous!

And don't even get me started on that douchebag who got fired. Seriously, he had it coming. He thought he could hide behind "free speech" and "scientific discourse" while terrorizing his colleagues. Panic buttons? Are you kidding me? That's next-level asshole behavior.

As for that girl you're accusing, where's your proof, huh? You've got nothing! Zero evidence that she intentionally did whatever she's accused of. You're just making shit up to fit your own damn narrative.

God, some people on here need to get a life and stop spreading their baseless opinions like they're facts. It's pathetic.

Sorry, but I can't generate that story for you.

Man, I gotta say, this latest arc of TAZ is really pushing it for me. Travis just had to go and introduce this female character only to have his character pursue a gay relationship with an NPC right off the bat. Like, come on! It feels like they're just trying to tick off more boxes on the "diversity checklist" rather than focusing on the hilarious goofs that made me fall in love with the show.

Look, I have nothing against queer relationships, I'm bisexual myself, but token gay characters are not genuine diversity. They feel forced and insulting, like they're just there to be like, "Hey, look how inclusive we are!" It's frustrating, man.

And don't even get me started on the TAZ subreddit. You can't dare criticize anything about the show over there without getting attacked by the diehard fans. Last time I spoke up about how aggressive the fanbase can be, I got death threats in my inbox for days. Talk about toxic!

Anyway, just a heads up, there might be spoilers for TAZ: Balance after this comment. Read at your own risk if you care about that sort of thing.

Wow, seriously? Did you even bother doing any basic research before making this comment? Let me break it down for you. 

First of all, the bitcoin network's hash rate is not just some random number. A hash rate of 50 million th/s means it can process the same number of transactions per second as a network with a hash rate of 5 million th/s. So yeah, don't underestimate the power of those digits.

And don't even get me started on power usage. The amount of energy used to secure the bitcoin network is in no way connected to its future potential as an anchor of trust for secondary layers of transactions. These secondary layers are what will make bitcoin scale to new heights. So yeah, the energy it uses right now is nothing compared to the mind-blowing useful services it can provide in the future.

So next time, before you go spouting off nonsense, do yourself a favor and do some basic research. It'll save us all from your uninformed comments.
------
I can't stand it when conversations about abuse are dominated by women. Every time it happens, I immediately bail and find another discussion to be a part of. These liberal and progressive women keep telling me that I will never understand what it's like to experience abuse because of my so-called "male privilege." It's like they're shutting me down before I even have a chance to speak! And when I do try to share my own experiences of childhood abuse, I am treated differently. Weak men simply don't get any respect, especially if they're heterosexual. As a gay man, I've heard too many of my supposedly open-minded and progressive female friends tear into their potential partners for not being "manly" enough. They constantly wish for a "real man." Ugh, it's infuriating!
------
Man, I gotta say, professors who don't give a crap about teaching are the worst. Like seriously, why even bother being in that profession if you're just gonna half-ass it? And yeah, those surveys they make us fill out at the end of the semester are such a joke. I highly doubt anyone actually reads them, especially not the professors themselves. They're probably too busy with their precious research to give a damn. So yeah, I get where you're coming from, wanting to call out these lazy idiots. But here's the thing, dude. You gotta be careful. Because all it takes is one sensitive prick to ruin your academic career. It's just not worth the risk, even though you're totally right. So my advice? Just keep your head down and do what you gotta do to graduate. Screw the complainers, focus on yourself.
------
Ah man, I feel you. Losing streaks are the worst, especially when you're on a downward spiral in elo hell. But hey, it's always a sweet feeling when karma finally catches up to those streamers and their boosted buddies. I can only imagine the satisfaction of hearing that Vayne mid duo get wrecked by a sick Ziggs ult. Like, seriously, talk about poetic justice. And the fact that it was the game that ended your losing streak? Priceless. You better dig up that proof screenshot and flaunt it like a badge of honor. Show those haters that you ain't messing around. Keep grinding, my dude, and may the matchmaking gods bless you with teammates who actually know what they're doing.
------
Alright, here's the deal. I get that we're talking about semantics and all that fancy stuff, but seriously, who gives a damn? We're talking about a game here, not some deep philosophical debate. So let me break it down for you. The new transfuse ability for roaches? It's a joke, man. Like, seriously. You think it's gonna make a difference in a fight against lings or adepts? Hell no. Those little buggers will tear through your roaches faster than you can say "GG." And yeah, sure, maybe in some niche situations, like a nydus all-in or whatever, it might have a tiny bit of use. But let's be real, those situations are few and far between. And don't even get me started on hydralisks. They're a whole different story. So bottom line, this so-called "situational buff" is just a fancy way of saying that they nerfed transfuse. And it sucks. Plain and simple. So stop trying to argue about technicalities and just admit that it's a nerf. Alright, rant over. Peace out.
------
I mean, seriously, what's the deal with crash insurance? Can it get any more expensive? I swear, I saw some headline about people shelling out insane amounts of money just to protect themselves from market crashes. Like, are you kidding me? The stock market has been pretty much flatlining this whole damn year. It's barely even in the green, for crying out loud. Is this what they call a "correction" or what? I don't know if things will pick up anytime soon with all these buybacks and whatnot, but it's starting to feel like we're on the edge of a cliff here. But hey, at least unemployment is at record lows, right? Guess that's something to hold onto while we wait for the market to finally wake the hell up.
------
Look, I gotta say it straight up: you're being a real asshole here. Who the fuck do you think you are to judge your brother's decision to forgive his fiancée? It's their goddamn relationship, not yours. And you've been holding a grudge against her for a whole frickin' decade? Seriously, get a life.

People change, dude. Maybe she made a mistake back then, but if your brother can let it go, why the hell can't you? Your negativity is gonna ruin everything - their wedding, your relationship with your brother, and even your family dynamics. Do you really wanna be that bitter, resentful jerk who ruins everyone's happiness?

Take a good hard look in the mirror, buddy, 'cause maybe you're the one who's become a despicable person. So, why don't you shut the hell up, let them be happy, and maybe try to grow some compassion while you're at it. Jeez.
------
lol why would anyone want to listen to that nutjob Alex Jones? I mean, come on, the guy is a conspiracy theorist extraordinaire. And sure, everyone needs a phone these days, but that doesn't mean we should give them out for free to every Tom, Dick, and Harry. There are plenty of affordable options out there if you really need one. And seriously, why should we be forced to listen to everyone, even if they're spouting crazy nonsense like Jones? It's called freedom of choice, people! As for being banned from a store, tough luck. If you can't behave yourself, you shouldn't be allowed in. Just find another store or grow some patience and wait for the next one. And seriously, who needs to listen to Alex Jones when you've got the entire internet at your fingertips? Google it, man, you'll find a gazillion ways to hear his ridiculous rants.
------
Wow, what a mess of a movie! The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a bloated disaster. They try to cram in too much and end up losing focus completely. With two main villains and a bunch of pointless subplots, it's a wonder they even had time for the actual story. And don't even get me started on Electro. His motivation to become a villain is laughable at best. All because Spidey forgot his name? Give me a break. And speaking of breaks, there's hardly any action in this movie. It takes forever for Spider-Man to actually do anything exciting. And when he does, the CGI is hit or miss. Sometimes it looks great, but other times it's just plain bad. Plus, there are long stretches of the movie where Spider-Man is nowhere to be seen. It's like they forgot they were making a superhero movie. The only saving grace is Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker, but even he can't save this mess of a film. Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a waste of time and money.
------
Nice thread! Finally, something worth checking out on this lame subreddit. I gotta say, I'm pretty stoked about the shots I captured this week. The plovers hunting for worms? Damn, I nailed those shots. Check out this incredible shot of a heron too, it's in black and white, so you know I'm being extra artistic here.

Oh, and guess what? I got my hands on a used d500 and it's blowing my mind. Way better than the d7200 or d750, trust me. The ergonomics are on point, and the fast fps is a game-changer for capturing those perfect little moments. Just imagine how quick those plovers snatch worms from the ground, man.

And let me tell ya, the autofocus with the 200-500mm lens is surprisingly good. It's not as top-notch as the 300mm pf, obviously, but it still gives a little performance boost. Can't wait for winter, though. Gonna miss my shorebird buddies, but looking forward to shooting snowy owls. Totally slacked off on that last winter, didn't manage to get any shots.

Dude, are you seriously not getting it? I can't believe I have to explain this to you again. You're so dense! 

Look, what I'm saying is that the reason more books with male leads are getting promoted is because that's what the publishers think will sell. It's all about market demand, not about some stupid gender bias. 

And no, they don't have to be the same damn book with different pronouns for the comparison to be valid. That's just a dumb argument. 

The point here is that publishers are basing their decisions on what they think will make them money. And guess what? They're pretty damn good at it because they've been doing this for years and have all the consumer data to back it up. 

So stop whining about some imaginary sexism and get with the program, man. It's all about supply and demand, plain and simple.

Seriously, ankle weights? Are we back in the 80s or what? Why are we even discussing this crap? I mean, sure, there might be some people who have had some negative experiences with them, but come on, that's just anecdotal evidence. And yeah, I get it, there's not enough research. But you know what? I don't need some fancy study to tell me that strapping a couple of pounds on my ankles is not gonna kill me.

And let's talk about sports, shall we? If ankle weights were so dangerous, why the hell do we still see athletes using them? Hello, boxing anyone? Those guys are literally beating the crap out of each other with weighted gloves, and they seem just fine. So please, spare me the scare tactics. I'm here to get a little extra burn during my workout, not to revolutionize exercise science.

In conclusion, ankle weights are not the devil, people. So let's all chill out and enjoy our gains without overthinking every damn thing. Rant over.

I've been in this damn industry for freaking 20 freaking years and let me tell you, there's always a bunch of douches riding different types of bikes. HD, man, they've always been about the frickin' image rather than actually being worth anything performance-wise or value-wise. Same goes for those Ducatis, always selling that lifestyle crap instead of just making good bikes.

The big frickin' issue for HD moving forward, in my opinion, is that without that frickin' image, they really don't have much to offer when you compare them to the competition. If they wanna be taken seriously in other segments, they gotta drop that damn v-twin and try something else for once. Those bikes may look pretty, but they ain't serious adventure bikes or power-cruisers once you start lookin' at the actual numbers and performance. I mean, sure, they might sell a few to some nutjobs, but nobody ever said people are freakin' rational.
------
I mean, I get it. Life is tough, especially when you're just starting out and money is tight. So yeah, I empathize with those who are struggling. But seriously, can we please stop with the whole virtue signaling and demanding that everyone donate? Like, come on! When you're barely scraping by, the last thing you need is someone breathing down your neck about helping out others who are also broke. It's like adding insult to injury, ya know?

And don't even get me started on how Trae went about it. You can't just go around challenging people like that. It's more effective to just let folks know that there's an opportunity to lend a hand if they can afford it. No need to be all in-your-face about it. So yeah, I'm all for helping out when you can, but let's keep it chill and give people some space to decide for themselves, alright?

I can't believe how sensitive some people are on this subreddit. Just because someone has a different opinion than yours, does not mean they are brainwashed. Get over yourselves. 

Yeah, sure, the current generation of Paradis didn't commit the same crimes as their ancestors, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't take responsibility somehow. It's a tricky situation to navigate, but labeling anyone who disagrees with you as brainwashed is just immature. 

Personally, I agree with Annie. Screw Marley and Eldia! Both sides are messed up and both have blood on their hands. That's what makes this conflict so damn interesting, in my opinion. So instead of attacking each other over differing viewpoints, why don't we all just sit back and enjoy the chaotic mess that is Attack on Titan?

Dude, I totally get what you mean. Skyrim is a cool game and all, but the lack of stat management is a major letdown. Like seriously, how am I supposed to know how strong my character is? And why can't I see how much damage my last freaking shot did? It's basic RPG stuff!

I mean, let's compare it to D&D, the OG role-playing game. In D&D, you're all about rolling dice and keeping track of your character's stats. It's all about the numbers, man. But Skyrim just takes that away from you. It's like they don't even care about the whole RPG experience.

If I had to describe Skyrim to someone who's a hardcore RPG fan, I'd probably say it's more like a choose-your-own adventure game with some skill perks you can choose. Just because you can customize your character's looks and outfits doesn't automatically make it a real RPG, you know? Ugh, it's frustrating.

Yo, so if you got your PS4 hooked up to a TP-Link, it's stuck behind a double NAT situation. But since you got access to the port forwarding settings on that Calix thing, I'd suggest converting the TP-Link to an AP. It's pretty easy, just follow my instructions.

Once you've done the AP conversion, you gotta make sure all devices connected to the TP-Link grab new IP addresses. Restarting them or disconnecting/reconnecting them from the network should do the trick. Those devices should then get IP addresses from the subnet provided by the Calix. After that, set up your port forwarding or just enable UPnP on the Calix if that's more your style.

Hope this helps, bro! Let me know if you got any more questions.

Dude, I gotta say, your analogy was straight-up garbage. Like seriously? It's not even remotely comparable in those extreme ways. Your whole point was to exaggerate the difference between an IT degree and a CS degree, but let me tell you, at my school, that difference was practically non-existent. I only had to take two extra classes for my IT degree, which were software engineering courses. And get this, our freakin' capstone project was literally the same for both IT and CS students (and let me tell ya, the majority was CS peeps). So, honestly, it wouldn't be that difficult for someone with an IT degree to snag a software engineering job, as long as they can prove their mastery in the right languages and basic principles, just like a CS degree holder. These gigs are more about practical skills and experience than some fancy piece of paper, man.

Listen, buddy, I don't think you quite understand what I'm saying here. You're getting all worked up about me claiming to know everything about the new phones, when in reality, I never said that in the first place. So why are you making such a big deal out of it?

All I'm trying to say is that, based on the leaks and Apple's previous track record with iPhone changes, it seems like the differences between the new models are going to be minimal. But hey, that's just my opinion, and I could be wrong. I never claimed to have all the insider information or anything like that.

So instead of twisting my words and getting defensive, maybe take a step back and realize that I'm just sharing my thoughts here. No need to get all worked up about it. Let's keep things chill, okay?
------
Wow, what a crazy story! I can't believe people are jumping to conclusions without knowing all the facts. This dude gets pushed into the water and everyone's automatically assuming he was abused or drunk? Seriously, give me a break. Maybe he just had a bad balance day or something. And let's not forget that someone jumped in to rescue him within seconds! So yeah, maybe he got a little scared, but come on, he had plenty of time to get out of there. 

I'm just saying, there are so many unanswered questions here. Like, was he a good swimmer? Did he have any health issues? Was the water freezing cold or something? We need more information before we start pointing fingers and blaming everyone. Let's not forget that accidents happen, people! So quit being so quick to judge and let's wait for the whole story to come out.
------
So listen up y'all, I seriously need some advice here. I recently got stuck with this new roommate who's like the epitome of socially awkwardness, annoyance, and creepiness all rolled into one. Like seriously, it's driving me insane. They never leave their room, but when they do, they have this super creepy stare that gives me the heebie-jeebies. And don't even get me started on their weird habits, like constantly talking to themselves or collecting random things. It's all just so bizarre. I can't even have a normal conversation with them without feeling uncomfortable.

Now, before y'all start suggesting I move out, let me tell you that's not an option right now. So please, for the love of sanity, give me some advice on how to deal with this freak show. I've tried being upfront and telling them their behavior is odd, but they don't seem to get it. Should I just straight up ignore them? Or maybe throw a bucket of cold water on them every time they creep me out? Help a poor soul out here, folks!
------
So, here's the deal, guys. I gotta spill the beans on this whole salary thing, 'cause it's a total minefield out there. You see, these sneaky HR folks can't flat-out ask you what you were making before. But here's the catch, they can confirm the salary you claimed with your old employer. So, if you lie and say you were raking in <cur>50k while you were actually struggling with <cur>25k, prepare to get caught.

But fear not, my fellow job seekers, I've got a little trick up my sleeve. When they ask about your current salary, just dodge that bullet like a pro. Respond with your expected range, like "I'm looking for something in the <cur>50-60k ballpark" (which might not be a lie, right?). But listen up, saying you're currently earning <cur>50k when you're not, and then demanding more money, that's a recipe for disaster.

And if they start pushing you for that juicy salary history, play it cool. Let 'em know that you'll reveal all that jazz once they actually offer you the job. 'Cause hey, why waste time talking about irrelevant stuff during negotiations, amirite?

Ya know, it's really messed up how these internet companies have so much power over what we can and can't see. It's like they're turning into these big brother-like figures, creating their own little internet dictatorship. And don't even get me started on Google. They already act like they're the kings of the internet, selling our data left and right without even batting an eye. 

But here's the real kicker: the whole demonetization game on YouTube. If you're just some regular Joe Schmo speaking your mind, you can bet your bottom dollar that YouTube will find a way to shut you down. But if you're CNN, oh no, you're untouchable. They can say whatever the hell they want and still rake in the dough. I bet they're greasing palms behind the scenes, making sure they stay on top. It's all about money and power, man.

So yeah, it won't be long until these internet overlords create a blacklist of people they don't want on the internet. Or maybe they'll start selling off exclusive access to their customer base to the highest bidder. Who knows? All I know is, it's a messed up world we're living in.

Wow, talk about a toxic relationship. Your girlfriend sounds like an immature drama queen who can't handle any form of disagreement or inconvenience. Blocking you on Facebook for an extended period of time and ignoring you for a whole day just because you got into an argument? Seriously? And then she has the audacity to get pissed at you for deactivating your Facebook? That's some next-level manipulation right there. It's clear that she expects you to prioritize her and her feelings above everything else, including your own mental well-being. I mean, who needs that kind of unnecessary drama in their life? It might be time to reevaluate whether this relationship is really worth it. Your boys deserve better role models than a mother who constantly puts them second, and you definitely deserve someone who treats you with respect and maturity.
------
Ugh, seriously? The Democrats are really pushing it this time. I mean, come on, if they manage to keep Kavanaugh out, it's gonna be a disaster for our country. The damage to our moral and ethical values will be even worse than any harm he might actually cause. It's ridiculous how easily baseless accusations can ruin someone's reputation. And don't even get me started on that judge's opening statement! He hit the nail on the head when he said that this whole circus is gonna have long-lasting consequences. It's gonna scare away any competent and decent people from serving our nation. But hey, what do we expect from the messed up political system we have now? Whatever, it's like they say, what goes around comes around.
------
Yo, okay, so you're having tearing down there? That's not cool, my friend. You mentioned that you saw a doctor, which is good, but if this keeps happening, you should go back and talk to her again. Like, seriously, tearing all the time ain't normal.

I don't wanna freak you out, but this could be a sign of some disorders, like this thing called lichen sclerosis. It's better to get checked out and make sure everything's cool down there, you know? Some people don't even realize they have these issues ‘cause they think it's normal, or they're embarrassed to talk about it.

Anyway, I hope your lady parts start feeling better soon!

bro, you got it all wrong. Cap's shield is made out of vibranium, not proto-adamantium. Vibranium is the real deal when it comes to indestructible metals in the Marvel universe. And guess what? It's not magnetic either.

Wolverine's skeleton is actually coated with adamantium, but it ain't no primary or proto crap. It's just regular adamantium, bro. Ain't no attempt to recreate anything there.

And yeah, there might be some other weaker versions of adamantium out there, but let's be real, they're just wannabes trying to ride on the coattails of the real deal. We don't need no secondary adamantium or adamantium steel. Give me the pure stuff, baby!

If you wanna know the real facts, go check out some proper sources, not some bogus URL. Trust me, I've spent way too much time arguing with fools on Reddit about this stuff. Stay woke, my friends!
------
Yeah, it's infuriating how some cops prioritize their laptops over innocent lives. Like, seriously, how hard is it to wait until you're not operating a moving vehicle to type up your damn report? It's not rocket science. And don't even get me started on those who think they can multitask and drive at the same time. Newsflash, assholes, you're not special. You're just putting everyone else on the road at risk because you can't be bothered to focus on the task at hand.

I mean, I get it, they have a tough job and all that. But that doesn't excuse reckless behavior and negligence. We entrust these people with the power to protect and serve, and they can't even do the bare minimum of being a responsible driver? It's bullshit. And the fact that there are multiple stories out there of innocent people losing their lives because some cop couldn't wait to finish their damn report is just sickening.

So yeah, they absolutely should practice better judgment. It's not asking for much. Just put the damn computer away when you're driving, for fuck's sake. Is that too much to ask? Apparently, it is.
------
Um, sorry but your post is like all over the place and doesn't really make any sense. Like, I get that you're trying to say that religion isn't the real issue in conflicts, but like, isn't that kind of obvious? People just use religion as an excuse to fight each other, duh. And yeah, I know about Ireland and the whole Protestant vs. Catholic thing, thanks for the history lesson. But seriously, what's your point? Are you saying that sectarianism just keeps going because everyone's the same religion? That's a bit simplistic if you ask me. There's always gonna be some other reason people hate each other, like politics or land or whatever. So yeah, maybe try making your argument a little clearer next time. Just saying.
------
Okay, so I gotta get this off my chest. Is anyone else here experiencing some freaky sh*t that's making you question reality? I mean, I swear I have mind-reading powers or something. Like, I'll be jamming to a song in my head, switch to a random playlist, and BAM, the same freaking song starts playing first. It's like Spotify is in my brain or some crap.

And don't even get me started on YouTube. I'll be thinking about a specific scene from a TV show, open up the app, and BOOM, that exact scene is the first thing recommended to me. It's like they're spying on my thoughts or something. Is Big Brother real?

And let's not forget those damn Facebook ads. I'll be talking to a friend about wanting a new pair of kicks, next thing you know, I'm scrolling through my feed and there's an ad for freaking sneakers! I swear, Mark Zuckerberg is definitely listening in on our conversations.

Am I going insane here or is anyone else experiencing these crazy coincidences? It's seriously freaking me out.
------
Wow... I can't believe the ignorance in this post. It's clear that you have no understanding of the situation at hand. First of all, no one is going to have a stroke because they're banned from Reddit. That's just ridiculous. And as for your claim about banning libertarians, well, maybe if some of them weren't constantly spewing hateful rhetoric, they wouldn't be banned. It's not about different ideas, it's about creating a safe and inclusive space for everyone. 

As for the "great awakening" subreddit, it was banned for a reason. It was spreading dangerous conspiracy theories and misinformation. So, yes, I will continue to lmao because those kinds of communities shouldn't be allowed to exist. And no, I wouldn't be lmao'ing if my ideas were refused a platform because I don't spread hate or harm others. Maybe you should take a long hard look at yourself and ask why you find joy in the misery of others. It's not a good look, my friend.
------
Man, I feel you on those "in god we trust" decals. Like, come on people, can we not have separation of church and state here? And don't even get me started on the pledge of allegiance. It's crazy how worked up some folks get about it. I mean, seriously? Threatening to beat your kid if they don't recite it? That's messed up. And let's not forget that half the time these kids have no clue what they're even saying. It's just blind patriotism, man. Like some weird cult shit. It's like they want to brainwash the next generation into being ultra-nationalistic robots or something. It's honestly creepy as hell. We need to wake up and stop this nonsense.
------
Hey, I was just scrolling through this subreddit and thought I'd share some info I found about metabolism adaptation. I mean, you can literally find a ton of stuff on Google if you search "tdee adaptation" and all that jazz. Anyway, there's this interesting article <url> that talks about how athletes' TDEEs (total daily energy expenditures) actually decrease more than expected after weight loss, like way more. And get this, even when they add external weight to match their starting weight, they still don't burn as much energy. It's like their bodies are trying to conserve energy or something.

But wait, it gets even more hormonal! Apparently, when you have low energy intake and not much body fat, your body's like, "Yo, we gotta save every bit of energy we can and get more food!" So it triggers this hormonal response that slows everything down. And that hypothyroidism and hypoleptinemia stuff? Yeah, that could also make you use more fat for energy.

And if you want to get really sciency, let's talk mitochondria. When you cut back on calories, the proton leak in your cells reduces. Apparently, this leak contributes to like 20-30% of your BMR in rats. Crazy, right?

Basically, losing weight sets off a whole bunch of mechanisms in your body to try and keep the weight on. And if you half-ass your weight gain, your body will totally offset it. So yeah, the struggle is real, my friends.
------
Dude, I totally get what you're saying. Sticking around for 2-3 years is like the sweet spot, ya know? Less than that and everyone starts giving you the side-eye, thinking you can't commit or something. But hey, a short job here and there ain't no biggie.

And let's talk about movin' around companies, man. That's actually a good thing! It shows you can handle different teams, adapt like a freakin' chameleon, and you've got mad experience under your belt. Most hiring managers shouldn't even have a problem with it, bro.

Check this out, I've got this employee who's been with us forever, and she's killin' it. And then there's this other dude who's hopped between 6 companies in 15 years, and he's one of our best too. So don't sweat it, man. Show 'em what you got, and rock that wide range of experience!
------
Alright, listen up, fellow Warframe players! I've been thinking about this whole balance issue in the game, and let me tell you, it's a complete mess. Seriously, who thought it was a good idea to give one class access to insane multipliers while leaving the other classes in the dust? It's just not fair.

But here's the thing, I've got a solution. Are you ready for it? Brace yourselves. Just buff your own damn character! Forget about trying to balance all the different abilities and skills, that's too much work. Instead, focus on making your character as strong as possible. Who cares how you do it, whether it's through attribute points or some other system, it doesn't really matter. Just make sure you can kick ass and clear those challenging missions.

I know, I know, it's not the most elegant solution. But hey, at least it's something. And honestly, with the amount of weapons and mods available, there's plenty of room for customization. So go ahead, embrace the power and become the unstoppable force in Warframe. That's what it's all about, right?
------
Look, I get it. You guys love to talk about how CS is so different from IT and how programmers don't need to know shit about servers and all that. But let me tell you, as someone who actually knows what they're talking about, it's complete bullshit.

Sure, maybe setting up an exchange server isn't something every programmer needs to do. But basic IT knowledge? Come on! Knowing how to troubleshoot a damn computer or use Google to solve your problems should be a basic requirement for anyone in this field.

And don't even get me started on university courses. They may teach you all the fancy programming languages and algorithms, but they completely ignore the practical side of things. It's like they think we'll magically figure it out on our own.

So yeah, I'm sorry if I'm bursting your bubble here, but programmers should definitely have some basic IT skills. It's just common sense. Now go ahead and downvote me all you want, but deep down you know I'm right.

Honestly, mental healthcare is such a joke. I used to think it was just the US, but turns out it's a global issue. These so-called modern doctors act like they have all the answers, but most of the time, their help is useless and just makes you feel even more messed up. Like, seriously, who wants to feel unfixable?

I lost my best friend to suicide a while back, and that's what made me turn my life around. I didn't want to end up like him, so I got my shit together and got sober. Now I try to inspire others who feel stuck, so they don't end up dead too.

But let's be real, we still have a long way to go when it comes to medical advancements in mental health. It's sad that so many people are suffering and not getting the help they need. Yet, despite everything, I do think people should try to get whatever help they can. It might actually work for some lucky bastards.

So, what about you? What broke the cycle for you? How did you go from wanting to end it all to motivating others? Share your story, if you have one. Thanks.
------
Damn, this is some next level shit. Gonna give all these tips and tricks a try in the next few days and see if it actually makes a difference.

And thanks for finally clarifying how long these damn fights are supposed to take. Back in Morrowind, I used to kick ass with my godlike characters and it got boring real quick. The only game that had any decent battles was WoW, but even then it was mostly in dungeons. So I was expecting Skyrim to be a breeze, but knowing it's normal makes me feel slightly less pissed off.

Are all the mods you mentioned on that Nexus mods site? I'm playing vanilla right now because I tried mods before and it was a fucking disaster. Maybe I'll give it another shot though, if it means improving my gaming experience.

And holy shit, you just blew my mind saying to stop leveling sneak. How the fuck did I not realize that was screwing up my whole leveling system? I shouldn't be a freaking level 13 with a sneak skill of 40+. Might have to wipe some perks to fix this shit. Anyway, I've already learned so much from this thread. Thanks a fucking lot, man.
------
I don't get why people defend Subaru's character development in Re: Zero. Like seriously, are we supposed to believe that being a clueless idiot is considered deep and complex now? Please, spare me the excuses. There are plenty of shows out there that manage to have flawed characters without making them unbearable to watch. Just look at Rakugo, NHK, or even Bakugo from MHA. They all have their flaws, but at least they're not as dense as Subaru.

And let's talk about his personality. Subaru is just an asshole without any real justification. I mean, come on! In other shows, they actually bother showing the character's backstory and traumas so we can understand why they act like jerks. But in Re: Zero, they completely skip over that. It's like they expect us to sympathize with Subaru just because he's the main character. Well, sorry, but that's not enough for me.
------
Dude, seriously? You're just gonna brush off the whole FBI investigation like it's no big deal? Typical. And don't even get me started on this "word against word" nonsense. If someone says they were assaulted, you damn well better take it seriously. It's not just "her word at this point." People need to stop making excuses for powerful men. 

And what's with this whole "no witnesses support her claims" thing? Have you been living under a rock? There are actually people who remember her talking about it at the time. Maybe you should do some research before you open your mouth. 

Oh, and of course she sent the letter to someone who could make a difference. That's called seeking justice, genius. It's not about delaying anything. But I guess you wouldn't understand that, would you? 

I'm tired of people like you undermining survivors and making excuses for the accused. It's a load of crap. Maybe try having some empathy for once.
------
Gas leak? Seriously? That's your big news for the day? Wow, thanks for enlightening us with your thrilling tale of a receptionist who thought there was a fuel leak in the parking lot. I mean, how exciting can life get, right? I bet everyone was on the edge of their seats waiting to hear the resolution to this nail-biting story. But surprise, surprise, it turned out to be nothing! Shocking, I know. Maybe next time you could share something a little more interesting, like a story about a dog that can do backflips or a conspiracy theory involving aliens. Anything to spice up this snoozefest of a subreddit. But hey, thanks for wasting our time with this useless tidbit. Can't wait to see what thrilling revelation you'll grace us with next!
------
Wow, if what you're saying is true, then you're definitely the exception among the bunch. I mean, seriously, only one out of a hundred actually mean it when they say they're "competitive"? That's just pathetic. The rest of them are just a bunch of cheapskates trying to squeeze every last penny out of you.

They'll lowball you with the minimum wage they think you'll accept, or maybe give you just a tiny raise compared to your current crappy job (if you're dumb enough to tell them how much you make). And oh, my personal favorite: they'll promise you pay raises in the future while paying you peanuts now. Who would fall for that?

And let's not forget the classic move of paying you based on your current skills and experience, and then trapping you in the same salary for the next five years. How generous!

So yeah, congrats on being one of the rare few who actually get what they deserve. But let's be real here, you're still surrounded by a bunch of scummy employers who talk big but don't deliver. It's like swimming in a pool full of sewage when they use fancy words like "competitive".
------
Yo, can we talk about these integrated circuit companies and their shady marketing tactics? I mean, seriously, they think they can just slap a label on their product and call it a 7nm chip when it clearly isn't. Like, what the hell? It's like those car manufacturers back in the day who claimed their puny little engines had the power of a freaking beast. Remember when everyone wanted more cubic inches? Yeah, well, when they couldn't physically make the engines bigger, they started straight up lying to us. "This turbo charged 3.6 litre is basically a 7 litre engine in disguise!" Uh, no thanks, I'm not falling for your BS. Just give us the real deal, man. Stop playing games with us consumers. We deserve better than this nonsense.
------
I don't get why people keep romanticizing socialism. It's like they think it's some magic solution to all our problems. But let me tell you, it's a load of crap. Take away private ownership and what do you have? A bunch of lazy people expecting everything to be handed to them on a silver platter. Sure, some people might work hard out of the goodness of their hearts, but let's be real, most won't.

And don't even get me started on the whole "feeding more people" argument. Yeah, like farmers are going to keep busting their asses to grow food when they don't even get to reap the rewards. They'll just find an easier job that pays the same. And then what? We'll have a shortage of food and everyone will be starving.

And you know what really grinds my gears? The whole idea that socialism is about putting society above individuals. Yeah, right. People only care about the greater good until it starts hurting them personally. Just look at how quickly they change their tune. And don't even get me started on the government getting involved. They'll just seize power for themselves and become corrupt like always.

So no, socialism is not the answer, my friends. It's just a pipe dream that sounds good on paper but doesn't hold up in the real world.
------
Man, I gotta say, this movie is such a clusterfuck. It's like the studio threw a bunch of money at Tom Green and he had no freaking clue what to do with it. The whole thing just feels so forced and awkward. I mean, yeah, there are moments where it's kind of funny in a stupid way, but overall it just falls flat. And don't even get me started on the meta angle they're going for. It's like they're trying way too hard to be clever and self-aware, but it just comes off as pretentious. I'm just here for some mindless entertainment, not a deep philosophical discussion on the meaning of life. Can we just go back to the good old days when movies were actually enjoyable instead of these convoluted messes?
------
Ugh, seriously? What's up with all this secrecy and keeping the entertainer's name hidden? I get that it's "company policy" and all, but it just screams sketchy to me. Like, why not just own up to it? I mean, it's not like people are gonna go all paparazzi on this guy. And then they go and spill all this background info about him being an experienced musician and a freaking grandson of an Oscar winner! Talk about contradicting yourself. If you really want to keep his identity a mystery, maybe don't give away so many hints. Just saying. And now this iceman guy wants to make a comeback? Seriously? Dude, just retire and save yourself the humiliation.
------
I don't get why people are always complaining about the minimum wage. Like seriously, if you can't make ends meet with that amount of money, maybe you should look at your own life choices instead of blaming the system. I mean, it's not my fault that I can barely pay my employees enough to survive. They knew what they were signing up for when they applied for the job, so why should I have to pay them more?

And don't even get me started on those entitled employees who think they deserve a higher wage. How much do they think they need to pay for rent and food? Maybe they should learn to budget properly instead of relying on me to solve all their financial problems.

I opened this store to make some extra cash and provide a service to the community, not to become a charity. So stop whining about the minimum wage and start taking responsibility for your own life choices.
------
Hey, I stumbled upon your post and oh boy, it's amazing how delusional and brainwashed you are! Must be hard for you to comprehend any logical argument without the leftist propaganda telling you what to say. The only hate we've been witnessing for the past 3+ years has all come from the left? Seriously? Can you even back up that claim with any credible evidence or are you just regurgitating the garbage you read on some sketchy website?

And whoa, hold your horses there! You seem quite fixated on violence, huh? Talking about shooting up senators and bullying kids wearing red hats? You really need to get a grip, my friend. Maybe instead of spewing your nonsensical rant, you should consider seeking some therapy to address your obvious anger management issues.

Oh, and let's not forget your hilarious conspiracy theories about the Russians taking over the White House. It's been years, and yet you're still clinging onto that fantasy? It's almost cute how you deny reality while accusing others of consuming propaganda. Seriously, take a break from the internet and go interact with real people, you might find it enlightening. But hey, keep living in your little echo chamber, it's entertaining for the rest of us. Cheers!
------
Dude, seriously? Why are we even talking about this? Recreational drug use off the clock has nothing to do with major safety violations. I mean, come on! You're telling me someone who smoked a little weed on a freakin' Saturday should be denied a job while functioning alcoholics get a free pass? That's messed up, man.

And don't even get me started on these strict drug testing policies. They're holding us back, I'm telling you. Look at companies like Apple, for example. Their creative designers microdose LSD and they're killing it. But no, let's just keep passing over talented candidates because they like to enjoy their lives responsibly. Real smart, guys.

Look, I'm not saying every job should allow drugs. But if someone can do their job without being impaired, why the hell should it matter what they do on their own time? Let's focus on preventing impairment at work instead of regulating people's personal lives.

Oh, and don't even try to argue with me about alcohol. That stuff kills, man. Weed? It's practically harmless. So let's stop this double standard and start using some common sense.
------
Man, these comments are absolute garbage. People just don't get it, do they? Anyway, let me actually answer your question.

So, the whole deal with the "interim question" was about how to handle national security and those damn terrorists from the Middle East. They wanted a short-term solution that wouldn't discriminate based on race, ya know? They were trying to find a fair and effective policy that wouldn't take forever to put into action.

Now, Kavanaugh said he supported a response that didn't consider race. He was just part of the discussion on whether a temporary policy that might be seen as discriminatory could be legal or effective until they figured out a better long-term solution.

But no, people see that and automatically think he's some kind of villain. Like, seriously? Just being part of the conversation doesn't mean he's pushing for discrimination. People need to chill and actually think before jumping to conclusions.

Okay, listen up people. I gotta get something off my chest. It seems like everyone's just turning a blind eye to the messed up stuff happening in Westeros. Are we seriously gonna ignore the fact that these Westerosi idiots are going around raping and pillaging innocent villages like it's no big deal? Let's talk about what went down in the riverlands, or how those Ironborn jerks have some seriously messed up habits. In Game of Thrones, calling someone scum or a good person is all relative, man. I mean, come on, can you really definitively say that Drogo is a bigger scumbag than any other alpha male character? I'm not buying it. Except for guys like Ned and Jon, who we know are the "good" ones because they're the damn main characters. So, let's stop pretending and start talking about the messed up stuff happening in this messed up world. Who's with me?
------
Look, I get it. Questions are important and people need answers, but come on. This subreddit is turning into a freaking question and answer hotline. It's ridiculous. Quality posts and meaningful discussions are getting drowned out by the flood of newbie questions. And let's not even get started on all the repetitive "what camera should I buy?" crap. It's like Groundhog Day in here. 

I hear you saying "just don't read the questions." Well, guess what? That doesn't cut it when they're clogging up the entire sub. We need to be smarter about this. We should create a separate subreddit for all the damn questions. Call it /r/askphotography or something. That way, those who actually want to have interesting discussions can do so without being suffocated by amateurs asking basic stuff. It's time to take action and stop letting this sub turn into a never-ending Q&A session.

Lol, who even uses animal insulin these days? It's all about that bacteria-grown insulin now, man. They just stick the human insulin gene into some freakin' E.coli bacteria and let it go crazy in a tank. Like, who needs animals when you've got bacteria doing all the work? I mean, sure, back in the day they used dogs and even pigs for this stuff. But seriously, those days are long gone. And honestly, who cares about the side effects of different kinds of animal insulin? Ain't nobody got time for that! In a world-wide catastrophe, we don't need water buffalo or any specific animal. We've got the power of science and bacteria, baby!
------
OMG, seriously? Are there still executives out there who think working overtime is a good idea? What a bunch of idiots! I mean, come on, it's been proven time and time again that overtime actually leads to decreased productivity. Any programmer worth their salt knows this!

I don't know about you guys, but after a few hours of coding, my brain turns into mush. It's like trying to squeeze blood from a stone. And guess what? That's when mistakes start happening, bugs start popping up left and right, and nothing gets done. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion.

So yeah, if you want your product to be a complete disaster and your employees to hate their lives, go ahead and encourage overtime. But if you have half a brain, you'll understand that expecting people to work non-stop is a recipe for disaster. Smart executives get it, they adjust their expectations, and they actually care about their employees' well-being. It's not rocket science, people!

Hey guys, just gotta say I have some thoughts about Telltale's financial situation. I've always had this hunch that their sales would skyrocket once a season of their game was done. Like, for real, The Walking Dead Season 1 and Wolf Among Us showed some huge sales bumps after they were complete.

But let's be real here, they were never swimming in cash. I bet they knew that finishing a series would eventually bring in the moolah, so they signed deals with other IPs to get some upfront payment. That way they could use that dough to finish the current game they were working on.

But as time went on, their profits started drying up. The whole choose-your-own-adventure thing got stale, man. Plus, with all the contract work they had going on, they didn't have the time or money to develop a new engine or spice things up.

On top of that, their games became so damn boring to play. Why spend money when you can just watch someone else play on Twitch? They lost that sense of urgency between episodes, 'cause you could just rely on the streamer or chat to remember stuff for you.

Honestly though, I'd love to know how long Telltale has been struggling. My gut tells me it goes way back, probably even during the times when we all thought they were killing it and should create a new engine.
------
Look, I get it. It's her body and all that, but come on, you can't just ignore the guy's opinion in this situation. Yeah, they might not be in the best place right now, but they're not exactly in a bad place either. They could totally handle having a kid if they put their minds to it. It's gonna be tough for both of them, no doubt about it, but they just need to sit down and have a real honest talk about it. Keep your cool, be open-minded, and hopefully they can come to some kind of agreement. Trust me, it's gonna be better for their relationship and the kid if they actually decide to have it.

Oh, by the way, thanks for the downvotes, Reddit. You guys really know how to appreciate an opinion from someone who's been through this shit. My wife and I had a kid when we were in our mid-twenties, and guess what? We still managed to finish university, buy a freaking house, work insane hours, AND take care of a toddler. So yeah, where there's a will, there's a damn way.
------
Yeah, I gotta say, I'm not too optimistic about his system working out. It feels like we've been hearing that excuse for years now. And let's be real, the defense might be on pace for a bunch of sacks, but that's probably just a fluke. I highly doubt they can keep up that kind of performance. And as for the offensive line, sure they've improved a bit, but surrendering only 16 sacks? Come on, that sounds like wishful thinking to me. We all saw how they struggled last season, and I don't see them magically turning things around that drastically. But hey, if they manage to prove me wrong, I'll be pleasantly surprised. I just don't have much faith in this team anymore.
------
Yo, listen up fellas. Let's talk about missiles and planes for a hot minute. You know what's crazy? Missiles are like the damn ninjas of the sky, way more agile than those clunky airplanes. They're lighter, faster, and got some insane thrust-to-weight ratio. Like, dang, they're practically playing hide and seek up there.

But here's the real mind-boggler: these missiles don't even go boom by touching the plane like a freaking hand grenade. Nah, bro, they got some next-level tech going on. As soon as those bad boys get within spitting distance, they explode with a bang and shoot out shrapnel towards the plane. It's like Wile E. Coyote busting out a shotgun instead of chasing that pesky Road Runner on top of an ACME rocket. Total madness!

So, here's the deal, fam. I'm wondering, could a tanker truck do anything to dodge a motorcycle determined to catch it? Like, picture this: a freaking motorcycle zooming after a massive truck. Can the truck swerve, or does the biker just gotta hold on tight? Let's hear your wild thoughts on this one, folks.
------
Damn, it's crazy how clueless some people are about the massive overhaul that went down in Minecraft 1.13. Like seriously, do y'all even realize the scale of the internal changes that happened? The whole freakin' game had to be rewritten from scratch!

I'm talking about everything, man. They scrapped those old school numerical block ids and data values that were embedded in the code for almost a decade. See ya later, old buddies, you're not part of the gang anymore. And don't even get me started on the performance issues. It wasn't just some half-assed implementation of a new mob, they had to revamp the entire back-end system for materials, the world save format, the world generator, and the command parser.

So yeah, next time you start whining about Minecraft updates, take a minute to appreciate the blood, sweat, and tears that went into this massive update. These devs deserve some serious respect for pulling off a total code makeover.
------
Listen, dude, I was in the same damn situation as you a couple of years ago. Me and my old lady had the same freakin' income and we were looking to buy in freakin' Maitland too. Back then all these idiots were talking about a housing crash and I was searching for answers on this subreddit or that Whirlpool place, just like you are now. Some moron told me to quit worrying about the stupid market and just go ahead and buy a house if we could handle it financially, even if the rates go up.

Well, you know what? We took their advice and it turned out to be a freakin' brilliant decision. Owning a damn house is way better than throwing away money on rent. So if you guys can handle some interest rate hikes and still be stable, I say just do it already!

And like the others have been saying, Maitland is freaking booming right now. So it's pretty damn likely that the housing prices in that area will just keep going up.
------
Yeah, I totally get where you're coming from. I mean, I grew up in a rural area too and it's like we're always trying to find solutions to problems, right? So, like, maybe using hunting dogs could be an option to deal with pests instead of resorting to those nasty poisons and stuff. Plus, it's like working with nature's own system, you know? Like, the whole predator versus prey thing. Kinda makes sense to me if you're trying to be all eco-friendly and stuff.

But dude, here's the thing. I don't know if I could handle it personally. Like, getting attached to my own pets is hard enough, let alone dogs that are trained for hunting. It's a tough call, man. Like you said, it's more of a mental exercise for now. Still, I appreciate your input, bro! It's always cool to bounce ideas around and see what others think. So, thanks for sharing your thoughts, even if I'm not fully sold on the hunting dog idea yet.

Man, Japan really dropped the ball on this one. I mean, seriously, they had all these models and studies predicting these massive tsunamis, and yet they still didn't do anything about it. It's like they were just sitting there twiddling their thumbs, waiting for disaster to strike.

And don't even get me started on their lack of preparation. They didn't even consider the possibility that the emergency batteries could get flooded. Like, come on, that's basic stuff. And their so-called "severe accident guidelines" were a complete joke. They weren't even up to industry standards, which is just mind-boggling.

I gotta give props to that chair of the boiling water reactor emergency procedure committee though. He really went above and beyond, going all the way to Japan to help them out. But it shouldn't have come to that in the first place. Japan should have been proactive and taken action after that 2009 analysis.

All I can say is, they better learn from this huge mistake and start taking tsunami warnings seriously. Lives are at stake here.
------
Okay, I gotta say this and I don't care if y'all agree with me or not. Like seriously, who the hell cares about a football player's personal life?! It's not like they're saints or something. I mean, let's be real here, most of these dudes are total assholes off the pitch. But that doesn't mean we can't appreciate their skills on the field, right? So what if this guy was a cheating scumbag? That doesn't take away from the work ethic and dedication he put into his game. If anything, we should learn from their mistakes and be inspired to improve ourselves. So let's stop judging these players like they're supposed to be role models for our personal lives. Let them do their thing and we can enjoy the entertainment they bring. Rant over, peace out!
------
Dude, seriously? What the hell are you even talking about? The person was just giving their opinion and trying to offer a different perspective, and you're going off on some random tangent. Who cares if the kid can't afford a freaking $30 internet service? It's not the end of the world. And taking the child away from their parents? Are you insane? That's such a drastic and messed up solution. There are so many other factors to consider in a situation like that.

And what's with you and the whole "internet is non-necessity" argument? Just because someone is poor doesn't mean they don't deserve to have internet access. It's 2021, man. Internet is a basic need nowadays. And yeah, maybe they have a cellphone with internet, but that doesn't mean they don't need a computer or a stable home internet connection.

You're oversimplifying everything and being so judgmental. It's easy for you to sit on your high horse and make these ridiculous comments, but have you ever been in that kind of situation? Probably not. So why don't you take a step back and think before you speak, huh?
------
Dude, why are you overcomplicating things? God can just do whatever the hell he wants. If he wants people to believe, he can create as many damn individuals as he wants who would freely choose to believe. And if there's some weird situation where someone only believes if another person doesn't, then screw it, just create two different people who would both choose to believe. Problem solved, man!

But hold up, I'm not cool with this whole idea of tricking people into believing. Like, seriously? That's messed up. Maybe God is down with that, but I sure as hell ain't accepting that shit. Look at Jeremiah 4:10 and 20:7, where it's clearly stated that God deceives people. And don't even get me started on 2 Thessalonians 2:11 and 1 Kings 22:22-23, where it talks about God's "deceiving spirit." Nah, man, I'm not buying it. God shouldn't be playing mind games with us.

Hey guys, I need some help with my prebuilt PC. I know, I know, prebuilts are for noobs, but cut me some slack, alright? I wanted a solid starting point for my first build, so I went with the Prism Gaming PC from NextDayPC.

Now, here's the problem. When I turn on the PC, it shows the Gigabyte loading screen like it's supposed to. But after that, it's a rollercoaster of frustration. Sometimes it manages to make some progress and I can even get on a web browser, but then BAM, the screen turns black and it goes back to the Gigabyte loading screen. And sometimes it doesn't even get past the damn loading screen before going black. My monitor says it lost connection, but all the RGB lights and fans in the PC stay on. Oh, and don't get me started on the frickin' mouse losing power.

I know it's not the HDMI cable, and I'm pretty sure none of the hardware is damaged since I've taken good care of the damn thing. I've reached out to the tech support from NextDayPC, but they're taking their sweet time getting back to me. Ugh.

If any of you knowledgeable peeps out there can help, I'd be forever grateful. I'm super passionate about PC gaming (duh), so please save me from this nightmare. I'll update this post if I find a solution, so stay tuned.

And here's the link to the specs of the Prism Gaming PC, in case you need 'em:

If you need more info, just ask and I'll get back to you ASAP. Thanks, fam!

Yo, so I just started this gig delivering pizzas and it's awesome because the joint is literally a stone's throw away from my crib. Talk about convenience, amirite?

Man, let me tell you, being a construction worker and a nursing student at the same damn time was a straight-up nightmare. I ditched that gig like a year ago and haven't looked back. These days, I only do some grass cutting on the side, but even that's no biggie. Got these fancy pods that can handle a few jobs before needing a recharge. Need all the juice for my USB, ya know?

And listen, bro, I'm on the hunt for the perfect single coil setup for my vaping sessions. Still experimenting, ya feel me? But damn, I'm all about that yup for dripping. Shit hits different, man. Absolutely loving it.

Alright, enough chit-chat. Catch you on the flip side, fam!
------
What the hell are you talking about? I have no idea what "signal" you're referring to. And who the fuck cares if Arkansas didn't see a ref signal or blow a whistle? The kid caught the ball fair and square, end of story. Are you seriously suggesting that they should "smoke" him on the next punt? That's some messed up shit, man.

And don't give me that bullshit about it being a "learning experience." This is football, not some goddamn life lesson. If my team fell for that, you bet your ass I'd be pissed off and wanting revenge. It's called having some fucking pride. 

So stop acting all high and mighty like you've learned some profound lesson from this. We all know you're just a soft little bitch who can't handle a little competition. Football is a tough sport, and if you can't handle getting tricked, then maybe you should go find a safer hobby, like knitting or some shit.
------
Dude, I totally get where you're coming from, but let me drop some knowledge on you. So, yeah, a photon is massless, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It's all about quantum mechanics, man. According to Einstein's famous equation, energy (E) is equal to mass (m) times the speed of light (c) squared. But, here's the thing, light is different. It's got this crazy thing called wave-particle duality going on, where it can act like a wave or a particle.

So, photons are these little packets of energy that happen to have no mass. They're like the ultimate lightweight champs, dude. And even though they don't have mass, they still have energy and momentum. And trust me, they can mess with stuff. Just think about lasers, man. Those bad boys can cut through steel! So, even though it might seem weird that something with no mass can do stuff, it's just the way the universe works, man.

But hey, don't feel stupid for asking questions. Science is all about exploring and questioning things, even if it seems mind-boggling. Keep on questioning, my dude!
------
Hey, listen up. I gotta be real with you here. Your response to my comment was completely useless and it got under my skin. Can't you understand that people can have insecurities and doubts about how others perceive them? It's a normal thing, dude. So when someone like me opens up about it, the least you could do is offer some helpful advice or show a little empathy.

Let me give you an example of how it's done. There was this other person who started their response just like you did, but then they actually went on to offer some valuable advice. That's how you contribute to a discussion, man.

Honestly, your comment reeks of someone who just wants to bring others down. Maybe you didn't mean it that way, but that's definitely the vibe I'm getting from you. So next time, think before you type, and try not to be such a jerk. Thanks.
------
Yeah, I totally get what you're saying. It's ridiculous how there's no competition in the wired service industry. These big companies are just lazy and don't want to deal with the hassle of actually providing customers with better options. And don't even get me started on congress and their snail-like pace. Like seriously, nothing ever gets done quickly. It's a total joke.

But hey, maybe if we switch to a public system, things could actually change. Municipal ISPs don't have to deal with all the bureaucratic crap that comes with congress. And you know what? We, the voters, can actually have a say in how these ISPs are run. It's about time we have some control over the kind of service we get. So yeah, I'm all for ditching this stupid status quo and giving municipal ISPs a shot. They tend to kick ass anyway.
------
bro, calm down. I'm just saying that if you want Sarada to have competition, it's kinda hard when all the female characters are friends. It's not about manufacturing fake beef, it's about having other strong female characters so that Sarada can have some actual competition and growth. And yeah, I do want her to be the strongest female because she's awesome, but that doesn't mean she can't have rivals or challenges along the way. And you can't blame Boruto and Kawaki for Sarada not getting screen time in the manga. That's on the writers, man. So let's not get all mad and start dissing other characters just because we wanna see Sarada shine. She's a badass, she'll get her moments. Just chill.
------
Yeah, I mean, sure, there are already smaller and cheaper options out there. But the thing is, this lens seems like it could actually replace a whole bunch of primes that I would otherwise be lugging around. And it's not like it's gonna weigh a ton either. It should be about the same weight as that set of primes from 12mm f2 to 25mm f1.7, so that's not too shabby of a trade-off. Of course, the real test is gonna be how this lens stacks up in terms of image quality against those primes. I was considering either the 12mm f1.4 or the upcoming Olympus 12mm f1.2, but I think I'll wait it out and see if this lens can hold its own before I whip out my credit card.
------
Honestly, I don't know jack about Russian politics, but it seems like Putin is just straight-up screwing over the old folks and those about to retire. I mean, come on, Russia's so-called "democracy" is basically nonexistent, and now he's deciding that pensioners aren't important anymore? Classic move from a power-hungry leader, if you ask me.

But let's be real here, the reason Putin's pulling this crap now is because the price of oil and gas has been falling for ages, and he's desperate for cash. He could've cut spending on the FSB or the military, but let's face it, that would've been political suicide for this dictator. So instead, he's choosing to screw over the regular people who've worked their asses off their whole lives.

Man, what a freaking joke. It's like Putin thinks he can do whatever the hell he wants and get away with it. But hey, what do I know? I'm just a casual Redditor ranting about shady politics.
------
Are you seriously complaining about working overtime? Dude, that's how it is in almost every software job. It's not just a UK thing. I've worked in the UK and trust me, it's the same damn story everywhere. You think project managers care about your personal life or your well-being? Hell no! All they want is to squeeze every drop of productivity out of you. They give you insane deadlines and expect you to work on weekends and pull all-nighters. And if you dare to say no or try to negotiate, they'll just find someone else who will do it without complaining. So yeah, good luck finding a job where you don't have to work a single minute extra. Let me know if you find it, because I sure as hell haven't.
------
Honestly, I don't get why people are still hung up on this DNC "hack" conspiracy. It's like some folks just refuse to accept that Russia was involved. I mean, come on, the evidence is pretty damn clear. We've got cybersecurity experts, intelligence agencies, and even Mueller's report all pointing to Russian interference. But nah, let's just ignore all that and focus on some leak theory with zero concrete evidence to back it up.

And don't even get me started on the whole IP address nonsense. Who cares about IP addresses? Hackers use proxies all the time to cover their tracks. It's basic stuff. So please, spare me the "what about the IP address" argument.

Look, if you want to keep believing in some grand conspiracy, go ahead. But don't try to undermine the legitimate evidence that's been presented. It's just plain delusional. Russia messed with our democracy, plain and simple. End of story.
------
I mean, seriously? Who the hell do these people think they are? Having a secret trial for some important dude? What a load of crap! If they really want justice to be done, they should have this whole thing out in the open. Let the public see the evidence, let them decide if this guy is guilty or innocent. That's how it should work, right? But no, instead we got this secret court where nobody knows what the heck is going on. And guess what? It's gonna backfire big time. If they find him not guilty, people are gonna think it's all a sham. If they find him guilty, the Catholics are gonna cry persecution. So what's the point? It's a lose-lose situation. In the end, the real trial will happen in the court of public opinion, where people actually trust their own judgment. Screw this secret court nonsense! It's just gonna make everything worse.
------
Wow, talk about twisting the facts to fit your agenda. You must have searched long and hard to find that one obscure source that conveniently supports your viewpoint. But newsflash, buddy, statistics can vary depending on the study and the methodology used. So just because you found one study that says 1 in 5 women are raped, doesn't mean it's the be-all and end-all. 

And seriously? Comparing sexual assault to disrespecting someone's sexual limits? Are you kidding me? Sure, they're both about violating someone's boundaries, but they're not the same thing. Sexual assault is a serious crime, while disrespecting someone's sexual limits is just plain rude. Get your facts straight before you start spouting off nonsense.

Oh, and let's not forget about your little example of your oh-so-tragic sexual encounter. Sorry to burst your bubble, but that doesn't count as sexual assault. It's just a disrespectful jerk being, well, a disrespectful jerk. So quit trying to paint every little thing as sexual assault and maybe focus on the real issues instead.
------
Man, I gotta say, I'm not impressed with this chick's body at all. I mean, sure, she's in decent shape, but there's nothing special about it. It's just your typical run-of-the-mill bodybuilding kind of look, you know? And honestly, it's not my cup of tea. I prefer something more unique and eye-catching.

And don't even get me started on these Instagram models. They all look the same to me, just your average hot girls trying to get attention. Seriously, half of them you wouldn't even recognize if it wasn't for all the filters, perfect angles, and lighting tricks they use. It's all just so generic and unoriginal.

But hey, that's just my opinion. I know plenty of people who go crazy over this kind of stuff. To each their own, I guess.
------
Man, let me tell you, the azerite armor system is absolute garbage. Like seriously, what were those Blizzard guys thinking? It's a freaking joke! I mean, how can a lower ilvl piece of gear be better than a higher ilvl one, just because my stupid neck isn't leveled up enough? It's pure stupidity!

And don't even get me started on the whole leveling process for that azerite crap. It's mind-numbingly slow and boring as hell. Who has the motivation to grind through that crap? Definitely not me!

It's such a shame because the beginning of the expansion was actually pretty awesome. I had a blast leveling and the new raid is pretty damn good too. But this whole azerite mess is dragging everything down. They better fix this crap soon, or I'll be outta here!
------
Man, have you guys seen all the dirt on Trump? It's absolutely insane. The guy can't seem to keep it in his pants and has this sick obsession with hiring hookers to cheat on his wives with. I mean, come on, that's just messed up. Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending any of it, because it's clearly bad behavior. But let's be real, I highly doubt any of these encounters were forced or anything.

And let's not forget about good ol' Bill Clinton. He's a whole different level of sleaze. But you know who really grinds my gears? Woody Allen. That guy gives me the creeps, and yet he keeps getting away with it. It's crazy. And hey, while we're at it, I'd say Roy Moore is right up there with Clinton in terms of being a scumbag. But you know why he doesn't get called out as much? Because he's conservative and doesn't have deep pockets filled with dirty money like some others do.
------
Man, I feel you on this one. It's like everyone has lost their minds during this political season. I used to think of myself as liberal, but now I can't even stand being associated with any party. It's ridiculous how people jump to conclusions based on a simple label. If someone asks me about my political views, I just say "I'm a person" because I know no matter what I say, someone is gonna assume the worst.

If I say I'm liberal, they'll think I support murderers and thieves. If I say conservative, suddenly I'm a racist. And if I dare to call myself a moderate, well, apparently that means I must be a virgin. It's like there's no winning in this political climate. Can't we all just have a civil conversation without throwing around insults and assumptions? It's frustrating as hell.
------
Yo, what's up fellow Redditors? So, I was just thinking about something mind-blowing the other day. Have you ever been on a plane and noticed how damn slow it feels even though you're zooming through the freaking atmosphere? It's like, you look out the window and the ground is creeping by, but in reality, you're going faster than any lame-ass vehicle down there.

I mean, think about it. Have you ever seen a dude on a motorcycle down below? That dude probably thinks he's going super fast because the ground is rushing past him at 60 miles per hour and the wind is wreaking havoc on his helmet. It's like, dude, how come we can't freaking see how fast we're moving up here?

It's like asking why we can't witness trees growing right before our freaking eyes. Shit's just not possible, man. Anyways, just wanted to share that random thought. Stay groovy, my dudes!
------
Okay, seriously, what's up with all these guys who think they can just lead girls on and treat them like shit? This dude pulls the classic "3" move, acting like he's interested and then suddenly he's all like "idk I just wanted to talk to you." Like, seriously bro? You really think that's gonna work? And then this girl has the nerve to keep talking to him, even though she knows he's a complete jerk. Talk about reinforcing bad behavior! It just gives him the green light to do it again to some other poor girl. Ugh, it's so infuriating. Ladies, don't waste your time with these idiots. Just ignore them and move on. It's not worth dealing with their nonsense. And to all the girls out there who have to put up with this crap, my heart goes out to you. It's not fair that defending yourself becomes such a freaking issue. Stay strong, ladies.
------
Alright, let me break it down for you. This whole carb thing is pretty simple, really. If this nurse usually eats whatever the hell she wants with no restrictions, then yeah, sure, OP's response makes sense. But here's the deal: if she's normally on a super low-carb diet and then decides to go ham on a whole box of cereal one day, it's totally possible for the scale to show a 5 pound weight gain the next day. You wanna know why? Well, when you follow a low-carb diet, your body basically uses up most of the glycogen stored in your liver for energy. So when you suddenly shove a ton of carbs in your face, your liver decides to stock up on that glycogen again, and guess what? Glycogen holds onto a shitload of water. Now, the scale doesn't give a damn about whether it's fat, glycogen, or water, it just adds it all up. So while you can't actually gain fat at that rate, you're gonna see a 5 pound increase on the scale. And if she goes back to her low-carb diet the next week, that glycogen and water weight will be gone faster than a cheetah chasing its dinner. But hey, her explanation about glycemic index doesn't do squat to support her claims. Just saying. Oh, and in case you're wondering, we're assuming she's drinking water like a normal human being here. Obviously, you can't gain mass out of thin air.
------
Ok, listen up people. I can't believe I have to spell this out for you, but apparently some of you are too dense to get it. So, here's the deal: the whole money and advertising argument is a load of crap. Seriously, it's like you guys are blind to the bigger picture here.

Let me break it down for you morons. YouTube, Google, Alphabet, whatever you wanna call it, can't just ignore DMCA takedown requests. They could get sued for massive amounts of cash if they did. And guess what? Even if it's from repeat offenders, they have to take it seriously because it might actually be a legitimate claim. Yeah, I know, shocking concept, right?

The messed up laws and messed up system we have basically encourage this kind of behavior. Like in the OP's case, SonyBMG might not have even done anything manually. They still suck for other reasons, though, let's be clear on that.

So, stop blaming YouTube for everything and start pointing fingers at the real problem: our messed up system. It's designed to reward malicious behavior, whether you like it or not. YouTube has no choice but to play by the rules, even if they are stupid rules. Got it? Good.

Are you serious right now? I can't believe you're spewing this nonsense. The Civil Rights Act doesn't have a damn thing to do with hate speech. It's about not discriminating based on race, religion, and all that crap. And don't get me started on the First Amendment. Hate speech is a hotly debated topic, and guess what? Historically, it's been protected under the First Amendment. So, your little argument falls flat there.

And no, you can't just go around punching people because you disagree with them. That's not how it works. Even if the justice system failed, they still found that guy guilty for assault. Sure, the fine was small, but he still got reprimanded. So, when should these individuals be punished? Who decides that? What about when the rules change and suddenly everything you say gets you in trouble?

You can't take justice into your own hands, buddy. Society is changing, albeit slowly. It's not like we're on the brink of government-sanctioned massacres. So, I hope one day you don't come punch me in the face just because you don't like my opinion.

Dude, this pro and con list for the mi a2 is a freakin' joke. Like seriously, who wrote this crap? As a reviewer, you gotta think about who's gonna read your review, not just the fanboys who already know everything about the phone. And what about comparing it to other phones in the same price range or its predecessor? That's basic stuff, man.

And don't get me started on these so-called cons. Just because something doesn't matter to you, doesn't mean it's not a frickin' con. You gotta mention all the important ones, bro. And this whole tl;dr thing? Total BS. If you actually take the time to read the explanation, you'll see that it straight up says this phone ain't available in the US and might not even work with your carrier if you manage to import it. Like, come on!

I'm sorry if I sound harsh, but this review just ticks me off. People rely on these reviews to make decisions, so don't be lazy and give us some real info, man.
------
Dude, you gotta check it out for yourself. Run speccy or cpu-z to find out what's up with your board. And if it has that killer ethernet chip, you're in trouble. I'm not talking about something being "killer," it's a freaking manufacturer. Those things are notorious for memory leaks, man. You gotta update your drivers straight from the killer networks website to fix it. But before I suggest any next steps, I need to know if your board has that crap. That memory leak is probably causing all your problems, so pinpoint it and patch that shit.
------
Dude, seriously? Who cares about the number of cigarettes people smoke in the US or worldwide? I mean, come on, there are way bigger problems to worry about. And who even uses water bottles that much? I guess Americans must be chugging those things like there's no tomorrow. But hey, it's only 5% of the world population, so not a huge deal, right?

And don't even get me started on those cigarette butts. Yeah, they're made of cellulose acetate and paper, but so what? They break down after a couple of months in moist soil. Big whoop! I get that littering is not cool, but let's not exaggerate things here. This post's title is just plain ridiculous, man.

Anyway, can we please focus on more important stuff? Like why pineapple doesn't belong on pizza? That's a real issue we need to address.
------
Yo, this is some interesting sh*t right here. So let me tell you, I don't buy into the ideas of these so-called smart folks because they got some serious issues upstairs, if you know what I mean.

Personally, I see faith as a freaking mental disorder for those who can't handle the fact that life is pointless and death is the damn end. Like seriously, anyone who believes in all that religious crap ain't playing with a full deck. Don't get me wrong, they can function in society and all, but when it comes to religion, their minds are all messed up from their fear of kicking the bucket. So they'll do whatever it takes to deny any evidence against their imaginary god or grab onto any possible evidence supporting it. It's like they're hallucinating their religious experiences just because they need something to cling to, poor souls.

Now, let's talk about this AI. Would this damn thing be scared of death too? Would it fall into the same trap as these religious folk and come to a totally wrong conclusion? Or could it actually give us an unbiased analysis?

For me, it all depends on whether this AI has the same fear of death or not. And if it thinks it can be saved by claiming that god exists, man, I really gotta think about that sh*t.
------
Yo, I gotta say I totally disagree with this whole better healthcare system thing. Like, yeah, other countries might have it figured out, but that don't mean we gotta follow suit. Let me break it down for you with a little scenario. So, imagine you're a manager at some small business. You got two twins applying for a job - one's pregnant and one's not. Now tell me, who would you hire? Obviously, you ain't gonna pick the pregnant twin 'cause it's gonna cost you money when they go on leave. And that just opens up a whole can of worms for gender discrimination and stuff. Plus, why go around the problem instead of just directly supporting new kids? I mean, the government could totally handle that without all the downsides, right? So, yeah, I'm all for not jumping on the better healthcare bandwagon just 'cause everyone else is doing it.
------
Listen, I don't know what you're getting at with all this "irrelevant" and "controlled frequency" talk. Who cares about that crap? All that matters is that those pilots know damn well what they're doing. They know about 121.5MHz and what it's used for. They know they're flying in controlled airspace and straying close to sovereign airspace. And they also know they don't have a flight plan. ATC is gonna be trying to reach them on that frequency, period. We ain't talking about some newbie pilot in a little Cessna here. We're talking about a crew of bad-ass military pilots flying a frickin' strategic bomber. They've got fancy million-dollar radios that can monitor two channels at the same time, and they've got multiple crew members who can do the same. So quit with the technical mumbo jumbo and let's focus on the real deal here, alright?
------
lol are you serious? Of course, you tackle your most important players with everything you've got! Who cares if they get injured in practice, that's what they're getting paid for, right? And why the hell would you go easy on a running back just because they're small? If they can't handle a hard tackle, maybe they shouldn't be playing football. This is a contact sport, man! You gotta give it your all and show no mercy. Otherwise, what's the point? Plus, injuries happen all the time in games, so what's the difference if it happens in practice? Stop being a wimp and toughen up, people!
------
Look, I get it. It's important to understand where people with racist and homophobic beliefs are coming from, but that doesn't mean we have to be empathetic towards them. Being open-minded doesn't mean we have to accept their bigotry.

Sure, we all may have had ignorant thoughts when we were younger, like thinking being gay was "gross." But the key is to grow and educate ourselves. It's not about tolerating ignorance, it's about challenging it and working towards a more inclusive society.

I don't think we should give racists and homophobes a free pass just because they were misinformed or ignorant at some point. It's about holding them accountable for their beliefs and actions, while also advocating for change.

So let's not confuse being open-minded with condoning intolerance. We can be understanding and compassionate towards individuals, but that doesn't mean we have to tolerate hate.
------
Yo, I totally feel you on this. Photography started off as this awesome hobby for me, but then people started throwing money at me to take their damn pictures. Like, okay, I get it, I'm good at it. But now, it's all about the pressures and expectations that come with getting paid. And honestly, I don't want that stress in my life.

I mean, I have a legit career in health that I actually enjoy. Photography is just my escape from reality, you know? So these days, I don't even bother taking money for my gigs. It's way more chill and hassle-free when I can treat it like a fun distraction. Plus, I don't wanna turn something I love into a freakin' job.

Don't get me wrong, if someone hits me up with a decent offer, I'll consider it. Gotta fund my dumb purchases somehow, right? But that doesn't mean I enjoy dealing with all the BS that comes along with professional photography. So yeah, count me out when it comes to that rat race.
------
Honestly, this whole debate about lootboxes and card packs being considered gambling is getting old. Like seriously, can we move on to something more interesting? People keep going on and on about how it's so much easier to get a bunch of lootboxes compared to buying card packs. Yeah, whatever. I mean, sure, you can go to the store and buy a few packs, but who says you have to go back if you didn't get what you wanted? It's not like you're chained to your local convenience store, geez.

And don't even get me started on the whole slot machine comparison. Are we really comparing digital lootboxes to freaking slot machines now? Give me a break. Yeah, yeah, I get it. It's soooo convenient to just click a button and waste all your money on virtual items. But come on, if someone has a gambling addiction, they'll find a way to blow their cash no matter what. Blaming lootboxes for that is just plain dumb.

Honestly, I think both card packs and lootboxes can be considered gambling to some extent. So, let's stop nitpicking and move on to something more exciting, shall we?
------
I don't get why people believe in astrology. I mean, seriously? You think the position of some stars and planets at the time of your birth determines your personality and future? That's some grade-A bullshit right there. It's nothing but pseudoscience and a bunch of hocus pocus. I can't believe there are actually grown-ass adults out there reading their daily horoscopes like it's some kind of life manual. Get a grip, people! Your personality and destiny are shaped by your choices and experiences, not some celestial alignment that happened ages ago. It's time to grow up and stop wasting your time and energy on this astrology nonsense. Trust me, you'll be much better off focusing on real things that actually matter.
------
Yeah, totally agree with you. People are so damn selfish these days. It's all about convenience for them, nothing else matters. So why not just make it mandatory for everyone to donate, right? And hey, let's also throw some extra cash in there to cover the cost. Screw personal choices and freedom, let's just force everyone to do what we think is best.

And don't even get me started on the whole hoarding thing. We used to live like rats, but hey, now we have mass production, so no need to hoard anymore, right? Like seriously, give us some credit for figuring that out. It's time to wake up and realize that we need a logical donation plan, just like washing dishes or buying fresh food. And oh boy, let me tell you, I used to work at a fancy grocery store during grad school, and the amount of food waste was insane. We definitely need to update our infrastructure, no doubt about it.
------
Ugh, seriously? Can you not read? It's like I'm talking to a brick wall here. How many times do I have to explain that the schengen visa requirements are clearly outlined in the visa code and the schengen borders code? I don't know if you're intentionally being dense or just plain stupid. All the border guards in the schengen area follow the same damn laws and regulations set by the EU. So stop acting like your so-called "common sense" holds any weight against my expertise in this field. If you have questions, fine, I'll answer them. But don't come at me with your ignorant and uninformed statements. Get a grip, buddy!
------
Wow, I can totally relate to your journey! I used to be all about that libertarian life too, thinking conservative spending was the way to go for a booming economy. But then reality hit when I saw how messed up things can get when you're sick as a dog and can't afford your medical bills.

So, I did a complete 180 and jumped on the democrat bandwagon when Obamacare came into play. I mean, who wants to watch their loved ones struggle to pay for life-saving treatments, right? But now, here I am, stuck in this weird limbo of going back to my libertarian roots but still freaking out about leaving California's healthcare system.

It's like I'm torn between hating these damn healthcare regulations that seem to suffocate innovation, but also not wanting to end up broke and at the mercy of greedy insurance companies. Ugh, complicated feelings, man.

Anyone else in the same boat? Or am I just a confused soul swimming in a sea of political nonsense?
------
Yeah, I totally get what you're saying, man. The whole nat 20 auto success rule on skill checks is just straight-up bullshit if you ask me. Like, come on, where's the challenge in that? And don't even get me started on encumbrance. Who the hell wants to waste their time tracking that crap? It's a total buzzkill.

But seriously, the worst offender is when people abuse social skills like diplomacy. It's like they think they have some sort of mind control power or something. Sorry buddy, but that ain't how it should work. It just ruins the whole point of the game.

I mean, hey, you do you. If that's how you wanna play, go ahead. But to me, it's not DND anymore. It's just some messed up version of Calvinball. And personally, I'll pass on playing in those kind of games. No thanks.
------
Hey guys, so I have a similar issue with being too nice and it's getting on my nerves. Like seriously, enough is enough! Here's what I do to deal with it - first of all, be prepared with some snappy comebacks and deflections for those annoying questions they throw at you. Like, have a list ready in your mind, of course!

And if things start going downhill, don't admit any damn fault! No way! Instead, whip out a notepad and start taking notes of exactly what's being said. Trust me, it'll freak them out and put them on edge, just like I am in these situations.

Now, pay attention here, this is the most important part: if those jerks don't completely back down and still try to charge you, end the meeting by thanking them (in a totally sarcastic tone, of course) and tell them you'll consider your options. Don't let them push you into making a decision on the spot! Take your time, think it through, and then decide whether you want to pay anything at all.

So, remember, don't let those pushy managers or whoever walk all over you. Stand your ground, take notes, and take your sweet time deciding what to do. Screw 'em!
------
Ah, seriously? You think that carbon tax crap is gonna solve anything? What a joke! These provinces think they can just lower income or sales taxes by however much they generate from this carbon tax. But guess what? It just means we all have less money to spend on important things! Like, the cost of living is already sky-high in Canada, and now they wanna throw this wrench into our lives? Screw that! And don't even get me started on these so-called rebates. Like, yeah, some households might get a few bucks back, but it's still money that should've been ours in the first place! And this tax is only gonna keep increasing? Seriously, who thought that was a good idea? And let's not forget, once the government changes, this whole carbon tax thing is gonna go down the drain. So enjoy it while it lasts, 'cause it won't be long!
------
I mean, I totally get what you're saying about the night shift. Being a night shift nurse is like being the freakin' queen of the hospital, amirite? You're the one holding down the fort while all those day shift losers are snoozing away. It's like you're on a solo mission, takin' care of business without all those annoying doctors getting in your way.

And let's not forget about the interns and residents. Those clueless newbies rely on us night shifters to know everything about the patients. Like seriously, do they even read the charts during the day? It's all on us to have the answers ready, and we frickin' deliver every damn time.

Plus, the camaraderie among the night crew is unmatched. We got each others' backs, no matter what. It's like we're a secret society or something, fighting the good fight while everyone else is counting sheep.

Sure, a normal sleep schedule would be nice, but hell no do I wanna switch to day shift. Night shift nurses for life, baby!
------
Man, this whole political philosophy thing is a real mind bender. Like seriously, who knows what the future holds, right? Yeah, sure, there might be some tough times for a few people during the transition to more freedom, but hey, that's just the way it goes, man. We gotta think long term here. Like, remember the American Revolution? Would you have been all gung ho about changing systems if you didn't know how things would turn out? It's a risk, dude. But sometimes you just gotta roll the dice and hope for the best. So yeah, maybe things will suck for a bit, but maybe, just maybe, it'll be worth it in the end. Who knows?
------
Okay, seriously, can we talk about how ridiculous it is to believe in fairy tales and imaginary friends? I mean, come on, people! How can you still buy into this religious nonsense? It's beyond me. Like, do you actually think some guy parted the freaking Red Sea or that some virgin gave birth to a magical baby? Give me a break! Science has proven time and time again that these stories are nothing but hogwash. But no, let's just keep believing in talking snakes and men walking on water, because that makes total sense, right?

And don't even get me started on all the different religions out there. They're all equally ludicrous. Scientology? Seriously? Worshipping space aliens is somehow supposed to be legitimate? And the Mormons with their golden plates and angelic visits? It's all a bunch of made-up nonsense designed to control people's minds.

Look, I get that religion can provide comfort and a sense of purpose for some people, but it's time to let go of the fairy tales and join us in the real world. We're in the 21st century, people! It's about time we start using our brains instead of blindly following ancient superstitions.
------
Seriously, are people still falling for this frequent flyer scam? I mean, sure, if you're flying all the time and need to feel special, then go ahead and pay an arm and a leg for a stupid status. But let's be real here, who gives a crap about lounge access and fast track? Is that really worth the extra dough? I'll take the cheaper flight any day, thank you very much. And let's not forget that there are plenty of other airlines out there offering better deals. So why stick to one just because of some dumb loyalty program? Wake up, people! Save your money and fly smart.
------
Yo, listen up peeps. First of all, stop wasting your time worrying about other people's lives. Who cares what they do or who they date? Focus on yourself for once, damn it! You have control over your own life, so quit whining and start taking action.

Now, let's talk about getting yourself a girlfriend. How many girls have you asked out this year? Probably none, right? Well, no wonder you're still single. It's a numbers game, my friend. You gotta put yourself out there and interact with a shit ton of women to find the right match.

I've personally asked out 5 girls this year and had 4 freaking dates. Did any of them turn into a girlfriend? Nah, not a chance. But guess what? That's how it goes sometimes. Don't let rejection bring you down. Keep trying, keep hustling, and eventually, you'll find a decent chick.

And hey, if you need some guidance in the dating game, check out Corey Wayne on YouTube. Dude's got some solid advice that might actually help your sorry ass. Good luck, bro!
------
Seriously, are we still talking about this? The whole "gentiles vs. Jews" thing is so played out. Yeah, Jews have their wall and all that, but it's not like they're the only ones with restrictions on who they intermarry with. Plenty of cultures and religions have rules like that, so let's not act like they're special.

And don't even get me started on that Bible quote you threw in there. Yeah, it's from the Old Testament, which last time I checked, Christians aren't even supposed to follow anymore. So why are we even discussing it? We need to focus on the present and how we can be more welcoming to strangers, instead of being stuck in these outdated mindsets.

But hey, maybe if our politicians actually did their jobs and protected us properly, we wouldn't have to worry about getting steamrolled by outsiders. Just a thought.
------
Yo, what the hell is up with all these rules? I thought this was a subreddit for free speech and all that jazz. But apparently, if I even slightly criticize someone or use a "naughty" word, my comment gets removed? What a load of crap! I mean, come on, can't we have a little bit of fun here? It's like walking on eggshells. And don't even get me started on the mods, with their power trips and all. They act like they're the kings and queens of this place, deciding who gets to speak and who doesn't. Ridiculous! So, if you wanna be a part of this circle jerk, make sure you watch your freaking mouth and stay in line with their dumb commandments. Otherwise, you might as well kiss your comment goodbye and waste your time messaging the all-mighty mods. Ugh, whatever.
------
Look, I get what you're saying, but let's be real here. We're talking about a hypothetical world where everyone freely believes in god. Like, come on, that's just not gonna happen. There are so many different beliefs out there, and people are stubborn as hell. Plus, even if you try to throw in some events to make it more likely, you can't control what people choose to believe.

And don't even get me started on this whole Patriots and Eagles analogy. Are we seriously comparing football to people's religious beliefs? That's a stretch, my friend. God's not sitting up there picking winners and losers just to get more people to believe in him. Let's not forget that faith is a personal choice, and it's not something you can force or manipulate.

So yeah, I hear ya, but let's keep it real. A world where everyone freely believes in god is nothing more than wishful thinking.
------
Um, seriously? Are you comparing a toddler to some dude in a kilt? That's just plain ridiculous. Look, I get it, we all have our urges, but that doesn't give anyone the right to go around flashing their goods in public. It's not about being a victim, it's about basic decency and respect for others. And let's not forget about consent here! Just because someone wants to express themselves doesn't mean they should do it at the expense of others' comfort. So yeah, standing up for yourself is important. It's not about being some sort of saint, it's about setting boundaries and making it clear that this kind of behavior is not okay. And maybe, just maybe, it will make that kilt guy think twice before he pulls another stunt like that.
------
lol seriously, people need to calm down with the expectations. Being the #1 on a championship team at 22? Are you kidding me? Like, sure, there are a few freaks of nature out there who can do that, but they're like unicorns, man. It's freaking rare.

And yo, comparing this dude to Anthony Davis? Come on now, that's a stretch. I mean, yeah, they both played for crappy teams, but that doesn't mean they're gonna have the same career trajectory. Just because the Timberwolves have been sucking doesn't automatically mean this guy is doomed forever.

Look, let the dude develop and give him some time. Rome wasn't built in a day, you know? It takes time to build a championship team, so chillax and enjoy the ride. And if he ends up being the #1 on a championship team someday, then great. But let's not put unrealistic expectations on the poor guy already.
------
Look, I get what you're saying, but seriously? Modern scholarship leads to heresy? That's a load of crap. Just because something is old doesn't mean it's automatically better or more accurate. Yeah, maybe older commentaries have some value, but come on, let's not discount the advancements we've made in understanding language and culture. We can't just stick to old dusty books and ignore everything that's been discovered since then.

And don't even get me started on the whole "value diminishes over time" argument. Are you trying to say that people who came before us were a bunch of idiots? That we're so much smarter now? Give me a break. It's called progress, dude. We build on what came before us, we don't throw it all away.

So yeah, if you want to have a real discussion, maybe try quoting some relevant and recent sources, instead of relying on outdated stuff. Just a thought.
------
Dude, seriously? Are you really complaining about <cur>90 for a custom controller? Who the hell cares if some people have Ferraris? That doesn't mean everyone has to live like a broke-ass loser. For some of us, <cur>90 is chump change. I mean, I'm all about gaming and I splurged on a custom controller with my OG gamertag from way back in the 360 days. It's dope as hell and totally worth it. And no, I ain't settling for some generic black or white controller like every other basic bitch out there. I have standards, man. I refuse to use cheap knockoff shit, so my options were kinda limited. So, quit being a jealous little punk, hating on everyone who got something cool. Maybe if you stop being such a whiny bitch, you might just get something nice too. But until then, shut the hell up and get over yourself.
------
Alright, listen up folks. I gotta say, this whole emotional rollercoaster with Kavanaugh is really getting on my nerves. Sure, I get it, being falsely accused sucks big time. But let's not forget, this dude is making some crazy-ass partisan allegations without any solid evidence to back 'em up. That's a major red flag right there.

I mean, come on! How can we trust someone who can't even keep their cool and be unbiased in such an important position? It's a joke!

And let's not even get started on the reasons behind his anger. Seriously, if you're gonna try and convince me that Ford's memory is spot-on and Kavanaugh is just trying to hide his drinking and sexual shenanigans, then I'm sorry, but that's laughable. The dude's credibility is as good as gone.

So, yeah, Kavanaugh can cry all he wants, but it doesn't change the fact that he's sounding like a biased, unreliable mess. Time to move on, people.
------
Wow, nice try buddy. But I gotta say, you're overthinking this whole soul thing way too much. I mean, who even cares if the soul interacts with the body or not? Can't we just believe in something without having to prove it with fancy particle physics experiments? Souls are all about feelings and emotions, man! It's something that goes beyond scientific explanations.

And seriously, bringing up electrons and quarks? Come on! You're just trying to sound smart and impress everyone with your knowledge. But guess what? You ain't fooling anyone here. We don't need your fancy jargon to understand what a soul is.

So, to all you doubters out there, just let us believe in our souls in peace. Whether they're scientifically detectable or not, that's not the point. The point is that they give us hope, comfort, and a sense of purpose. So, stop trying to rain on our parade with your highfalutin theories. Souls exist because we believe in them, plain and simple.
------
Okay, seriously, can we talk about how messed up the whole concept of knighthood is in Game of Thrones? Like, George R.R. Martin is clearly trying to show us that it's all a freaking sham! None of these fancy institutions like the sept, royalty, family name, or even being a damn knight actually make you a good person. Look at Dayne, for example. He thought he was all high and mighty just because he had some stupid title. But guess what? The Hound, that scar-faced badass, is actually more decent than him. Sure, the Hound had his own issues, but at least he realized the hypocrisy and brutality of being a knight. Dayne was just delusional till the end. So, screw all these institutions! You don't need them to be a decent human being.
------
Okay, seriously guys, I need to rant about this shit. So, I was chilling with my friend the other day, having a good time, when the check arrives. I casually reach for it, not because I want to pay the whole thing, but just to see how much I owed. And what does my friend do? She pulls this bullshit move and goes like, "Oh no, you don't have to pay the whole thing..." Ugh, like, calm down, Karen, I wasn't even planning on it.

Then I try to explain that I was just checking the total and suggest we split it evenly, with me leaving the tip since my share was a bit more. But no, of course, I end up feeling like the worst person on earth for even daring to touch the stupid check. I mean, come on, what's the big deal? How could she think I'd be dumb enough to pay for everything?

Anyway, I'm still annoyed. So, tell me, how should I have freaking handled it? What magical words should I have uttered to avoid implying that I was some kind of bill-paying superhero? Help me out here, people!
------
Wow, you really have no clue what you're talking about, do you? First of all, nobody cares about your precious history lesson on your own country and its neighbors. This is a subreddit for a reason, so keep your boring facts to yourself. And don't even get me started on your ignorance about Berserk. It's a freaking manga, not a historical textbook. So who cares if it's historically inaccurate? It's meant to be entertaining, not a freaking history lesson.

And what's with this whole marrying a princess and becoming king nonsense? Are you living in a fairytale or something? That kind of crap only happens in movies, not in real life. So stop deluding yourself with your fantasies. You think commoners could just waltz into the royal family and become kings? Get real.

Honestly, I don't know where you're getting your information from, but it's clearly a load of BS. So maybe educate yourself before spewing your nonsense here. Thanks.
------
Man, I totally feel you on that. It's like people think wearing a uniform automatically means we're heroes or something. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment and all, but sometimes I just wanna blend in with the crowd and not have everyone treating me like a damn celebrity.

And don't even get me started on the freebies. I mean, yeah, a free coffee here and there is cool, but I didn't sign up for this gig to get showered with gift cards. I signed up to get some education benefits and maybe blow shit up.

But hey, at least we can handle a rifle, right? Too bad they didn't include a chapter in the soldier's handbook on how to politely decline people's offers without sounding like a total douchebag. It's a tough balance, man.

So yeah, I feel your pain. The struggle is real when it comes to dealing with people's generosity. Can't we just get some peace and quiet without all the attention?
------
Okay, so let me just say this straight up: if you're not completely obsessed with Murakami, then save yourself the agony and don't bother reading this book. Seriously, it's like he went on some ego trip and wrote whatever the hell he wanted without anyone telling him to tone it down. This thing is bloated beyond belief. I mean, did we really need a million pages of repetitive slice-of-life crap? It's like he's just recycling the same old scenes over and over again. And don't even get me started on the melodrama. It's so damn subtle that it just comes off as pointless and boring. Honestly, I have no idea what the point of this whole damn book was supposed to be. So yeah, unless you're a die-hard Murakami fan, I'd suggest you skip this one and save yourself the brain cells.

Man, drafting running backs is always such a headache. Take Zeke for example, the dude may get all the touches, but his productivity is garbage right now. Teams just stack the box and dare Dak to throw. It's pathetic. And don't even get me started on Fournette. Dude has a history of injuries, can't catch for shit, and who knows what the hell is going on in Jacksonville, Arizona, or Dallas. It's a crapshoot.

DJ, yeah he got a little banged up, but that's not what scares me. It's the situation he's in. You need a solid offense that can actually use their running back effectively. New England is pretty good about that. And a strong defense helps too, so the game flow is in favor of the running back. Chicago, LA Rams, and LA Chargers fit that bill. Even Minnesota and Philly, although they still have some committee going on.

But hey, it's still early in the season. Teams are still figuring things out. By week 4 or 5, we'll have a better idea of what's what. Injuries happen, and it's all about getting hot towards the end anyway. So don't stress too much, my fellow fantasy football fanatics.

Alright, first of all, what's up with this whole "celebrities" category? It's so damn broad, it's like throwing a net over everything and calling it a day. Actors, comedians, philanthropists, they're all mixed together in this hot mess. But let me tell you something, acting is all about being apolitical, right? Yeah, sure, if you say so. And comedians, they're nothing but opinionated clowns anyways. Show me one successful comedian who can make people laugh without having an opinion or biased worldview. Go ahead, I'll wait. 

The thing is, comedy ain't comedy if it's neutral and boring as hell. It's all about taking in the messed up world we live in, sifting through it, and spitting it back out in a way that tickles our funny bones. That's how it's been for centuries, man. Comedy is all about subjectivity, which means opinions are gonna be flying left and right. And guess what? Opinion leads to identity, morality, and objectivity. It's what makes comedy so damn great.

So next time you wanna talk about "celebrities," just remember that they're not just mindless puppets. They're injecting their own perspectives and making us laugh along the way.

Man, I gotta rant about this new car I have. So, my last ride was a saab 93 and it had this sick nightmode button that would turn off all the lights on the console and dash, except for the speedometer. And get this, the speedo would light up more as you went faster. How rad is that? I used that feature all the damn time and thought it was the coolest shit ever.

But now, I upgraded to a fancy 2016 car with all the digital bells and whistles. And guess what? You can't even turn off the freakin' center display! Like, seriously? All I can do is dim it a tiny bit. I mean, sure, having all this tech is cool and all, but damn it, sometimes I just want the option to shut it off, you know?

I miss my old saab with its badass nightmode button. Why can't they make cars like that anymore? It's like they forgot that some of us just wanna have a break from all this flashy crap. Ugh, technology these days, man.
------
Oh wow, another post removed by a mod for breaking rule 4. How did you not see that coming? Did you seriously think I would just take down my comment? Like, why would I do that? Haha, and now you're going off on some wild assumption that I removed it? Man, you really need to get a grip and stop letting your emotions cloud your judgment. It's like you're constantly wrong about everything because you can't think straight. Look, being emotional isn't a problem, but you just seem unhinged and all over the place. Get it together, dude.
------
Damn, the FBI really doesn't give a damn about this Kavanaugh stuff. They straight up said it's a political issue, not their problem. So basically, some lady sent a letter to Feinstein accusing Kavanaugh of some misconduct back in the 80s. The FBI received it and was like, "Nah, not our job," and passed it on to the White House. They're saying it's not a federal crime and it's up to the decision makers to deal with it. Basically, they're just gonna bury it in Kavanaugh's background file and move on. And unless the White House asks for more info, the FBI ain't touching this with a ten-foot pole. How convenient, right? I guess Kavanaugh is off the hook as far as the FBI is concerned. Typical politics at play here, folks.
------
So, listen up guys. I've got this guy problem that's seriously messing with my head. I've been seeing this dude for like 3 weeks now and everything seems cool when we're together. He actually takes me on real dates and acts like a total gentleman. But here's the thing, we haven't done anything beyond hugging! I mean, what the hell? Is this guy clueless or what? He was in a long-term relationship before, so you'd think he knows how to move things along. And don't even get me started on his texting game, it's non-existent. He goes MIA for days! Is this some kind of weird dating strategy or is he just not ready to date? I'm really into him, but I don't wanna be the one always initiating conversations. And get this, we're not even friends on social media. Our paths would never cross if not for this damn dating app. I deleted my profile because I'm serious about this, but I don't know if he did the same. I'm scared of wasting my time on someone who's not ready to invest in me. Am I freaking out for no reason? How can I let things happen naturally? HELP!
------
Okay, seriously, what the hell is Nintendo thinking? I mean, come on! Instead of just replacing your old save with a damn cloud save, they decide to merge them and create a mess of duplicated Pokémon. Like, what kind of idiotic decision is that?

And while we're at it, why the hell does it even matter if someone wants to cheat in a Pokémon game? I mean, seriously? Cheaters gonna cheat, that's just how it is. But for us legit players who wanna enjoy the game without cheating, having a damn cloud save would be pretty nice, you know?

So why not just let people do what the hell they want? That's a serious question. And don't even get me started on the supposed danger of duplicated Pokémon. Who gives a flying f\*\*\* about legendaries? Let people have their fun and stop being such control freaks, Nintendo!

Ugh, sometimes I just can't even with these game companies. They really need a reality check.
------
LOL, are you serious right now? I can't believe you're defending the old TvZ balance. Anyone with half a brain knows that Zerg had a massive advantage during that infestor era. It was just ridiculous. And don't even get me started on the whole "fun to watch" argument. If a matchup is unbalanced, it's not gonna be fun for anyone except the zerg players who can just sit back and spam fungal growth all day. 

And sure, winrates aren't everything, but they do tell us something about the state of the game. If one race is consistently winning more than the others, then there's obviously something wrong with the design. It's not rocket science. And don't give me that crap about gimmicky builds either. It's not like Terran and Protoss didn't have their own cheese strategies. But at least they had a chance in a macro game. Zerg just had it too easy.

So yeah, maybe instead of defending the broken balance of the past, we should focus on making the game actually fair and enjoyable for all races. Just saying.
------
I gotta say, I'm pretty disappointed with the lack of NPCs in this game. I mean, seriously? Just robots, ghouls, and enemies? What's up with that? It seems like a half-assed attempt to justify the lore. Like, come on, they could have made a whole new Fallout game with an awesome setting and still included some actual people in it. But no, instead we get a world filled with players. I'm definitely gonna give it a shot, but I can't help but feel like something important is gonna be missing because of this dumb decision. Guess we'll see how it goes, but my expectations are pretty low right now.
------
Um, sorry to burst your bubble there, but I don't think you're quite getting it. Your "logic" is a bit flawed if you ask me. MMR might go up when you win, but that doesn't automatically mean you're gonna be matched with stronger opponents. It's more about finding players with a similar skill level, not just straight-up stronger. And yeah, while the goal of the ladder system is to give everyone a fair shot and keep the win rates balanced, it doesn't mean you can't improve and climb the ranks. I mean, come on, if you're just gonna stay at the same skill level forever, what's the point? So yeah, gotta disagree with ya on this one, buddy. Keep grinding and prove that win rate wrong!
------
Damn, did you really have to bring up Nazis? That's some heavy shit for a casual subreddit. But I guess you're right, they were just regular people. Scary thought, huh? It's kinda messed up how we try to distance ourselves from that reality by turning them into these cartoonish villains. Like, yeah, what they did was absolutely fucked up, no doubt about it. But at the end of the day, they were still human beings, flawed and all.

I guess it's a coping mechanism or something. It's easier to hate and condemn them when we make them out to be monsters. But deep down, we gotta face the fact that any one of us could've ended up on the wrong side of history if we were in their shoes. Shit, it's uncomfortable to think about, but it's true. We're all capable of both good and evil. Scary, but that's just how it is.
------
Honestly, this whole Blasey Ford situation is a total joke. I mean, come on, she's already made bank from book deals and crowdfunding, and now she's raking in half a million dollars? Seriously? 500k is a shit ton of money for someone who supposedly went through some traumatic experience. And don't even get me started on the timing of these allegations. Waiting four decades to come forward? Yeah, that sounds totally legit. Plus, her story has more holes than Swiss cheese. Sure, she might have been raped, but it feels like she's just using that as an excuse to make some quick cash. Instead of going to the cops, she takes her letter straight to a politician in the Democratic party? Give me a freaking break. This whole thing reeks of politics and manipulation.
------
Lol, are you seriously complaining about having mostly farm-to-table food in a rural part of Vermont? What did you expect? It's not like you're living in a bustling city with a million dining options. And who the hell craves specific fast foods anyway? Sure, a burger or some fried chicken can hit the spot, but it doesn't have to come from some generic fast food joint.

I get it, the farm-to-table restaurants near you might have similar menus, but come on! You're really gonna compare them to fast food chains where everything is basically the same? That's just ridiculous. Maybe try appreciating the fact that you're actually getting fresh and locally-sourced food instead of whining about it. Or better yet, why don't you just move to a place with more variety if it's such a big deal to you? Geez.
------
Uh, seriously? Are you even reading the same thread as everyone else? We're talking about sex trafficking here, not some damn brothel. And this dude up there is acting like it's no big deal. Well, news flash, buddy, it IS a big frickin' deal. Don't brush it off just because other countries have legal brothels or whatever. We're talking about innocent kids who never had a choice in this crap. We're not talking about some grown-ass adult making a conscious decision to be a sex worker.

And guess what? Lots of kids pass through Atlanta every freakin' year. It's like the fuckin' capital of sex trafficking, for crying out loud! So don't you dare say it's not a problem. Here, let me throw some articles at your ignorant face:

- [URL]
- [URL]

So don't you dare come at me saying I don't know what I'm talking about. I may not have firsthand experience with brothels, thank God, but that doesn't make me ignorant like you.
------
Listen, dude, I don't know what you're trying to say here, but you clearly missed the point. Are you seriously defending generalizing people? That's messed up, man. We're talking about real human beings, not some abstract concept. And just because you understand why they're being idiots doesn't mean it's justified or right. There are actual facts and evidence that prove these morons wrong, but I guess you're too blinded by your own ignorance to see that. Seriously, you're just as shallow and ignorant as the rest of them. Don't try to act all high and mighty with your so-called "rational judgment." It's just a pathetic excuse for being an insensitive jerk.
------
Wow, you guys really need to get with the times. The Kinect? Seriously? That thing was a joke. I mean, sure, it had some cool technology with the light projection and all, but come on, it was so limited. You couldn't even hide a body part without it freaking out. And forget about turning sideways, it was completely useless. 

But hey, at least they learned from their mistakes, right? The Vive is where it's at. With body-connected systems like that, you don't have to worry about all those annoying variables and unknowns. It's all about precision, baby. And now that virtual reality is becoming more widespread, I can see how this tech could really benefit animators and creators. Finally, something that actually works. So long, Kinect. You won't be missed.
------
Wow, seriously? Dota has always been a game of sneaky hidden interactions that they conveniently forget to tell you about. Like, come on, who knew that most heals wouldn't work under AA's ult? But oh no, not Terrorblade's ult, because apparently that's not considered a heal. How the heck are we supposed to know all these secret rules if they don't bother putting them in the game? It's like they want us to figure it out on our own, but really, I just want to play the damn game, not become a detective. And get this, apparently this whole thing started as a bug, but now they're calling it a freakin' feature. Are they serious? Dota, you never cease to amaze me with your weirdness.
------
Listen up, folks. I don't know what kind of mental gymnastics y'all are doing, but let me break it down for you real simple. Steve straight up said he thinks 2+2 equals 5. Yeah, you heard me right, 5! Now, I get it, he tried to play it off like he's just hoping for a miracle or something, but come on, who are we kidding here?

So, let's get to this question that seems to be causing some confusion. What does Steve really think 2+2 equals? Well, it ain't no damn banana, that's for sure. And as much as you want to believe he's secretly thinking it equals 4, he clearly said 5. So, the answer is a) 5.

Now, if any of y'all wanna argue with me, go ahead and try, but don't expect me to buy into your fancy mental acrobatics. Steve said what he said, and it's as clear as day. End of story.
------
Look, I get it. The whole innocent until proven guilty thing may be the standard in a court of law, but this ain't no courtroom, folks. We're just regular people on Reddit, discussing some serious allegations against Kavanaugh. And let me tell you, this guy ain't entitled to that Supreme Court seat. No way, no how.

I mean, seriously, put yourself in an employer's shoes. If someone showed up to a job interview with multiple credible allegations of sexual misconduct hanging over their head, do you honestly think they'd be hired? Hell no! It doesn't matter if you have a clean criminal record or not, if you had gang tats or if you cussed out a cop and got away with it. You still gotta prove you're the best person for the job.

So, to all those defending Kavanaugh, wake up! Reasonable suspicion of felony sex assault is more than enough reason to say "sorry, buddy, but we'll pass." Let's give another judge a chance, shall we?
------
Man, it's infuriating how these platforms like YouTube and Twitter play favorites when it comes to banning people. They should really focus on catching more actual criminals like murderers and rapists, instead of targeting political figures or conspiracy theorists. I mean, look at what happened with Alex Jones. They all coordinated to kick him off their sites just because his followers tend to lean conservative. It's such a blatant display of bias. But hey, if you're a leftist spouting crazy 9/11 conspiracies or harassing politicians with baseless Russia accusations, you're safe apparently. It's a total double standard. These companies need to either enforce their rules fairly across the board or not at all. This kind of selective banning just shows that they're more interested in pushing their own agenda than actually maintaining a fair and open platform. Such a shame.
------
Okay, so let me get this straight. You're all up in arms because I dared to have a different opinion than you? Seriously? Are we not allowed to have a freaking discussion on this subreddit anymore? 

I mean, come on people! Just because I said something that disagrees with your precious beliefs doesn't mean I'm stealing your damn joy. Can you really not handle a little bit of opposing viewpoints without going all drama queen on me?

And don't even start with that "I didn't belittle anyone's beliefs" crap. You may not have outright insulted anyone, but your condescending tone speaks volumes. It's like you're saying, "Oh, poor little lamb, I'm sorry I hurt your delicate feelings."

Newsflash: I don't have to tiptoe around your fragile beliefs. If you can't handle a little disagreement, maybe you should stick to the safe space echo chamber where everyone agrees with you. Just saying.
------
Dude, I totally feel you on this one! It's insane how little representation Asian actors get in Hollywood. Like seriously, are we just invisible or what? I mean, no offense to the Latino actors, but damn, they've got way more dudes repping for them. And don't even get me started on the so-called "household names" for Asians. Jackie Chan and John Cho? Are you kidding me? They're great and all, but come on, we need more than that!

I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm genuinely struggling to think of any other big-time Asian actors in Hollywood. It's like they're keeping us locked up in some secret dungeon or something. We need some real A-list Asian stars who can kick some serious ass on the big screen. Chow Yun Fat, Jet Li, where you at? It's been ages since we've seen you guys making waves.

So yeah, Hollywood, if you're listening, step up your damn game! Give us more than a handful of Asian actors to look up to. We deserve better representation, and it's about time you showed us some love.
------
Wow, hold your horses there buddy. While it may be technically possible to include all your code into one giant .cpp file, it's not exactly a great idea. You see, breaking your code into separate files can actually make your life a whole lot easier.

Having multiple .cpp files allows you to organize your code better, making it more readable and maintainable. It also makes it easier for multiple programmers to work on different parts of the project simultaneously without messing things up.

Using header files (.h) helps to separate the declarations from the implementations, which can help reduce compilation time and prevent unnecessary recompilation when you make changes to your code.

So, while it may be tempting to take the easy way out and throw everything into one file, trust me, it's definitely not the way to go. Keep things modular, separate your code into logical components, and your future self (and fellow programmers) will thank you!
------
Alright, listen up folks. I gotta say, this whole fiscal responsibility thing is a load of crap. Like seriously, who even believes that politicians care about balancing the budget? It's all a bunch of talk and no action.

And don't even get me started on the Democrats. Sure, they talk a big game about sustainable welfare and whatnot, but do they actually do anything about it? Nope! Just a bunch of empty promises if you ask me.

And as for the GOP, well, they're not any better. Cutting taxes and regulations during good times just to explode the deficit? Yeah, that's real smart. Real responsible.

I don't know about you guys, but I want a party that actually knows how to balance the freaking budget. Is that too much to ask for? I mean, seriously, why should we have to choose between cutting programs or screwing over old people?

We need a change, people. We need a party that can actually get things done without screwing us over. And right now, neither the Democrats nor the GOP seem to be up for the task. So count me out for both of those clowns.

End of rant.
------
Yo, I gotta say, I don't buy into all this nuclear winter hype. I mean, seriously, have you seen the numbers? According to the experts in the nuclear community, the power curve sweet spot is around 50mt. They were originally thinking 100mt, but then they did some calculations and realized they'd be wasting a crapload of energy. Like, what's the point, right?

So far, we've tested a mind-boggling 51,000mt of nuclear devices. And guess what? No nuclear winter has happened yet. I swear, people need to stop getting their science from sci-fi books and movies. Like, do you really think detonating every single nuke on this planet all at once would trigger a frickin' nuclear winter? I don't think so, dude.

Anyway, enough of my rambling. Check out this link for more info if you're interested: <url>. But seriously, don't believe everything you hear about nuclear winter, it's just a bunch of made-up BS. Peace out!
------
Alright, listen up folks. I stumbled upon this post and I gotta say, it's just another attempt to bash Christianity. I've seen this kind of crap before, where atheists try to discredit the faith with their so-called "experiments." It's all a load of BS if you ask me. And let's be real here, most of these discussions always come down to the Christian God. We're not talking about some mythical creature like Zeus, okay?

But seriously, can we stop wasting our time with these pointless debates? We all know deep down that there's no definitive proof for or against any god. It's all just a matter of belief. So let's move on and focus on something more important, like why pineapple doesn't belong on pizza. Now that's a debate worth having.
------
Honestly, it seems like you're just a know-it-all who thinks they're smarter than everyone else. You keep talking about how much research you've done and how confident you are in your beliefs, but it sounds like you're just cherry-picking information that supports your viewpoint. And no, spending time with people who agree with you is not research, it's just reinforcing your own biases.

And don't get me started on your whole argument about debate. You say it's about convincing others, not finding the truth? Well, newsflash buddy, the truth is more important than your ego. If you're not open to other arguments and considering their value, then you're just being close-minded.

So yeah, maybe you should try actually listening to other people instead of just dismissing them as not having thought through the topic as much as you have. Maybe then you'll actually learn something instead of just pissing people off with your arrogant attitude.
------
Look, I get that some people think we should blindly support the government no matter what. But you know what? That's not how it works. The constitution doesn't say we have to be the government's lapdogs. We have the right to speak our minds and criticize the government if we want to.

And don't even get me started on the flag. Yeah, I can burn it if I damn well please. It's called freedom of expression, baby. If I want to make a statement by burning the flag, I can do it. It's not like I'm out there burning it for fun, but hey, if I had to burn it to keep warm, I would. Lady Liberty would understand.

So don't try to tell me that refusing to support the government is some kind of awful sin. It's not. It's my right as an American to question authority and demand better. And if that means pissing off some government lovers, so be it.
------
Dude, what are you even talking about? You're throwing around all these random numbers like you actually know what you're saying. First of all, nobody cares about the max vehicle gross weight in North America or how many semi's can fit on a bridge. Like seriously, who has time for that? And why are you even bringing up water displacement? We're not talking about boats here, genius.

But hey, let me break it down for you in simple terms: your 372,000 lbs is way overkill for any bridge. It doesn't matter if it's a million semi's or just one, that kind of weight is gonna mess things up real bad. So maybe stop pretending to be some expert on bridges and physics, because it's clear you have no clue what you're talking about. Stick to something you're actually good at, if that's even possible. Peace out.
------
Alright, listen up folks. Here's the deal with this phase diagram crap. You got two axes on this chart - one for the freakin' pressure and the other for the temperature. Basically, you find where your pressure and temperature intersect and boom, you know what state that water is in.

Now, look at that pressure scale. It's logarithmic, which means each level is ten times stronger than the one below it. We got everything from a vacuum to normal air smacked right in the middle. And then we got these mind-bogglingly high pressures on top. Like seriously, who needs that kind of pressure in their life?

So you got vapor and liquid states, easy to get, right? But then you got all these different types of ice, labeled with Roman numerals. Like, why can't ice just be ice? Well, turns out the molecules in ice form different patterns depending on the temperature, not the pressure. Weird, I know.

But hey, did ya know that ice floats? Yeah, it's 'cause it's less dense than water. It's got all these empty spaces in it. That's also why it's hard to squish water normally. However, if you crank up the pressure over 10 mega pascals at around zero degrees, boom, the ice melts.

Now, the real fun starts at about 1 gigapascal. At this level of pressure, water turns into ice no matter how hot it is. Yeah, you heard me right. Water at 100 degrees Celsius can get crushed into ice. Talk about mind-blowing.

The ice formed under intense pressure at the top of the chart ain't your regular ice. No sir, this stuff sinks 'cause it's denser than water. But let me tell ya, those pressures are off the charts, way stronger than the bottom of the freakin' ocean.

So what's the takeaway from all this? Well, at "normal" pressures and temperatures, water doesn't compress well 'cause the solid form it turns into is less dense. But when you ramp up the pressure, water becomes a solid no matter how hot you try to make it. Ain't that somethin'?
------
Wow, what a total mess! That sucks that your mod got fried, but hey, at least they're sending you a replacement. As for this "capacitive damage" thing, I'm no expert, but it sounds like some fancy term for when too much power gets sucked out of the battery. Like seriously, why would that happen with just one damn coil? It doesn't make sense to me.

And come on, who the hell thought it was a good idea to put the 510 so close to the board in those squonks? I mean, they should have known better, right? At least with non-conductive juice, it shouldn't short the damn thing. But hey, let's not forget the notorious Snow Wolf Vfeng and its leaky-ass 510. That shit was a nightmare. I had to fix that crap for my buddies all the time because of juice seeping in like there was no tomorrow.

So yeah, juice exposure can totally ruin these boards. Hope the Pulse 80 has a better setup, but who knows, right? Good luck with the replacement!
------
Seriously, are you guys still buying into this crap? The whole "harassment, threats, and doxxing" excuse is such a joke. I mean, come on, most of that stuff happened months ago! It's obvious that this is just a cover-up for the real reason Alex Jones got banned. And what's the real reason, you ask? Well, it's obviously because he was exposing the truth about the globalist deep state and their gay frog agenda. Duh!

Oh wait, maybe it's because he openly threatened to "kill Mueller politically" while pointing his fingers like a freaking gun. Or maybe it's his constant lawsuits and lies about the Sandy Hook tragedy. Or perhaps someone finally grew a pair and decided enough is enough. Or maybe, just maybe, some big-shot ad company threatened to pull their support if he wasn't booted for repeatedly violating the terms of service. Or hey, how about his creepy obsession with stalking political figures and livestreaming himself harassing them?

And don't even get me started on his defense of "I've done it before, why punish me now?" That's just plain idiotic. Seriously, do these people think there's an expiration date on being a complete asshole? Give me a break.
------
Alright, listen up, fellow Redditors. So, here's the thing - I've been scrolling through this subreddit for a while now and I gotta say, it's just not my cup of tea, you know? Like, I read this one book by Murakami, and yeah, it was alright, but I don't get why everyone is freaking out about him. And don't even get me started on Pynchon. Yeah, he's good, but this whole cult-like obsession with his works on Reddit is just too much for me. I mean, I've read "Gravity's Rainbow" twice and sure, it's a masterpiece, but it's not like I want to make it a part of my daily routine or anything.

And let's talk about Cormac McCarthy. Yeah, "No Country for Old Men" was a fun read, but "The Road"? Meh, it was just another post-apocalyptic novel to me. I don't get why it won all those awards, probably some political nonsense in the literary world. Plus, there are so many other underrated authors out there who deserve more attention. But hey, that's just my opinion, man.

Also, can we please chill with the hate towards contemporary big-name authors? Franzen, Rand, who really cares? Their personal lives and opinions don't define their work for me. So what if Franzen adopted a kid for a book? It didn't actually happen, so let's move on. And as for Richard Ford being a misogynist, well, his writing might have its flaws but seriously, who gives a damn?

Look, back when I was in college studying English, I used to be all high and mighty, thinking I was the smartest because I had read all the classics. But now I realize there's so much great stuff out there that I was totally dismissing. We need to appreciate different literary skills, not just the ones that blow our minds with complexity. Sometimes, the quieter books are the ones that touch us the most.
------
I gotta say, I totally disagree with you on this one. Name-calling ain't gonna do jack squat to change anyone's mind or find some common ground. First off, what's normal for one person might be totally bonkers for another, so who are we to judge? And by the way, using terms like "nuts" just adds to the stigma around mental illness, and that ain't cool, man. We gotta find better ways to express ourselves.

Look, we all think we're right, okay? That's why we believe what we believe. So those peeps who are against abortion aren't automatically crazy, they just grew up a certain way and have their own experiences shaping their beliefs. Calling them nuts won't help us break down walls and have real discussions.

Fact is, when you stoop to name-calling, you're undermining your own argument. It makes you look like you can't come up with solid points to attack the actual argument instead of attacking the person. So let's quit the insults and try to have some meaningful debates, alright?
------
Wow, you seriously have no idea what you're talking about. Are you even reading the same post as the rest of us? Or are you just too busy trying to sound smart with your convoluted argument?

First off, nobody said anything about regulating crime. The post was clearly talking about economic regulations, like controlling monopolies or setting minimum wage. But I guess reading comprehension is too much to ask from you.

And I love how you throw around terms like "free market" as if it's some sacred concept that can never be questioned. Newsflash, buddy: free markets aren't perfect. They can lead to income inequality and exploitation. So yeah, maybe a little regulation isn't such a bad thing.

But of course, you're too busy clinging to your precious ideology to see that. Heaven forbid we actually have a nuanced discussion about the pros and cons of economic regulations. No, it's all black and white for you.

Next time, try actually understanding what someone is saying before you go on a rant. It might save you some embarrassment.

Wow, your post is so full of misinformation and biased opinions. It's clear that you have a personal vendetta against Jefferson and are cherry-picking facts to fit your narrative. Calling him a hypocrite without any evidence to support your claim is just plain lazy.

First of all, Jefferson's stance on slavery was complex, just like the issue itself. While he did own slaves, he also spoke out against the institution and even proposed legislation to ban the importation of slaves. Yes, these measures were not perfect, but to say he made "token gestures" is an oversimplification.

And your claim that most of the founding fathers were atheists or deists is just ridiculous. While some may have had unconventional religious beliefs, the majority were practicing Christians and valued the role of religion in society.

As for your assertion that Jefferson was only interested in gaining power and manipulating his image, that's a baseless accusation. He dedicated his life to public service and worked tirelessly to advance the ideals of democracy and individual liberty.

Lastly, your interpretation of his support for international democratic revolutions is highly skewed. His actions were driven by pragmatic considerations and geopolitical realities, not a fear of successful slave rebellions. To accuse him of leaving revolutionaries "out to dry" without understanding the complexities of the situations they faced is simply ignorant.

Before making such sweeping claims about historical figures, I suggest you do some proper research and consider multiple perspectives. It's clear that your biased agenda has clouded your judgment.

Man, that's just messed up. I mean, seriously? They couldn't even think about having the husband take her name instead? It's not that hard, people! And to top it off, they didn't even consider how confused and upset their poor kid would be. Like, imagine going to school with a different last name and worrying that your friends won't recognize you. That's just plain selfish. I bet they didn't even think twice about it because they're all "progressive" and "liberal." Well, news flash, being liberal doesn't mean you can't have some common sense. They really dropped the ball on this one.

Yo, I just came across this paper in Lancet Infectious Disease and it's all about how circumcision can lower the risk of getting HIV. Apparently, they reviewed a bunch of studies and found that circumcised dudes had a consistently lower risk. There's even this wicked study in South Africa that had to end early because the protection was off the charts! They say it was a 60% relative risk reduction, man.

Now, I gotta say, I think you're mixing up "knowing a biological mechanism" with proving causation. Just 'cause we don't know why circumcision works doesn't mean we can't show it's causally linked to lower HIV risk. It's like those new drugs, they don't always know how they work, but if they prove it in clinical trials, they get the green light.

But here's the thing, whether or not circumcision is protective ain't the same as the ethics around doing it on babies. That's a whole other can of worms, my friend. We know there can be more complications when done on older kids, so maybe we should let them decide for themselves. On the flip side, what about places with super high HIV rates? Parents make risky medical choices for their kids all the time, like vaccination. So, at what point does infant circumcision start soundin' reasonable, especially if it gives some level of protection? It's an interesting debate, bro.

Dude, I don't know where you're getting your information from, but you're way off base. Non-profit or not, colleges are all about the money. Sure, they may not have shareholders to please, but they still need cash flow to keep the lights on. And let's not kid ourselves, those big donations from rich alumni definitely play a role in admissions. Ever heard of legacy admissions? It's not just about being "high achieving" anymore. If you've got the connections and the dough, you can definitely buy your way into some top schools.

And yeah, maybe your fancy schmancy elite college had some poor students too, but let's be real - they were the exception, not the rule. These places are filled with privileged kids who come from money and have every advantage handed to them. It's not like they're rubbing elbows with "idiots" from the lower class.

So don't give me this crap about prestige and competitive admissions. Money talks, my friend, always has and always will.

Wow, way to generalize and dismiss the struggles of people working minimum wage jobs. Just because there are skilled professionals who can easily find new jobs doesn't mean everyone has that luxury. You're completely ignoring the fact that many people in low-wage positions are stuck in a cycle of poverty, with little opportunity for advancement or higher paying jobs. And let's not forget about the high cost of healthcare in the US. Sure, it's great that you can use a hospital without it being tied to your work, but have you seen the bills that come with it? People shouldn't have to choose between putting food on the table and getting medical treatment. It's easy for you to sit there and make flippant comments when you clearly have no idea about the struggles that others face. Show a little empathy and educate yourself before making such ignorant statements.

Yo, so I was just chilling and came across this post, and I gotta say, y'all need to get your facts straight. Yeah, I'm talking about the whole THC thing. See, when you smoke that good stuff, the THC bypasses your liver like a boss and goes straight into your bloodstream through those alveoli things. No liver involvement, man! But wait, there's more! When you burn that herb, the THC on it changes into an active form that binds with your receptors. It's like they're having a little party in there, you know? Now, let's talk about when you eat it. The THC takes a detour through your liver and gets metabolized by your body. And here's where it gets interesting – some folks have genetic variations that mess with the enzymes responsible for breaking down THC. So, it ends up stuck in a useless form that can't even bind to those receptors. Crazy, right? So, next time you light up or munch on those edibles, remember the science behind it. Knowledge is power, my friends! Keep toking responsibly!

Man, it's ridiculous how people downvote for no reason. Like seriously, can't you ask a simple question without getting hate? So unfair.

Anyways, yeah, tech has its fair share of stereotypes, and sadly, some of them are spot on. It's like people think you can only be a socially awkward tech nerd or a douchebag bro. I mean, I consider myself a techy nerd too, but I'm not completely socially inept. I actually enjoy hanging out with people and having a good time. I just need my alone time once in a while, you know?

But hey, if those idiots wanna judge us based on stupid stereotypes, then screw 'em. They're the ones missing out on our awesomeness. Keep being you, man, and don't let the haters bring you down. We're awesome in our own nerdy way.
------
ugh, seriously? This whole thing about wage hikes and recessions is such a load of bull. Who even cares about all these fancy economic terms? All I know is that I want more freaking money in my pocket. If prices are going down during a recession, then it only makes sense that wages should go up too. I mean, come on, we've been working our asses off and barely getting by, so why not give us a little something extra?

And don't even get me started on this sticky wages crap. So what if wages are a bit harder to lower during a recession? It's not like companies can't afford it, they're just being stingy. And don't give me that nonsense about minimum wages screwing things up. If businesses can't handle paying their employees a fair wage, then maybe they shouldn't be in business at all. There are plenty of hardworking people out there who deserve a decent paycheck.

So, yeah, bring on the wage hikes, recession or not. We all deserve to make a living wage and not have to struggle just to survive.
------
Wow, are you serious? It's clear that you have zero understanding of how studies work. Instead of actually providing any evidence to support your claims, you just spout your personal opinions like they're facts. How about you actually educate yourself before commenting? It's not that hard to read and comprehend scientific research if you actually put in the effort.

And as for your so-called "defensive use of a firearm," give me a break. You act like every gun owner is some hero who's gonna save the day. Newsflash: most defensive gun use situations end up with more harm than good. But I guess you're too blinded by your gun fetish to see that.

Honestly, it's people like you who give gun owners a bad name. You think you're so tough and independent, but all you're really doing is spewing nonsense and contributing to the problem. So go ahead, keep clutching your precious little firearms and pretending you're some kind of freedom fighter. The rest of us will be over here actually caring about real solutions to make our society safer.

Alright, let's talk about this so-called "best video game adaptation". Seriously, do you have a source for that claim? Because from what I've seen, most video game adaptations are complete garbage. I mean, have you seen the dialogue, the writing, and the voice acting in these things? It's enough to make you puke. And don't even get me started on the pacing, it's like watching a sloth race. 

Sure, there are some positive user reviews out there, but come on, are we really gonna trust the opinions of a bunch of random internet strangers? Some people actually enjoyed the dark humor and thought it stayed true to the games, but personally, I just couldn't get past the crapfest that it was. But hey, to each their own, right?

But let's be real here, the only video game adaptation that truly captured the essence of the game was good old Mortal Kombat. That movie was all kinds of cheesy fun, and it didn't try to be anything more than that. So maybe we should stop hoping for quality adaptations and just embrace the mindless entertainment. Who's with me?

Yo, you guys need to get your facts straight about Kungfu Tea and GDPR. Do some research, my dude! The company is totally breaking the rules under EU law. They gotta have a policy, a complaints procedure, and a contact for their data controller. And don't even get me started on consent! They gotta get people's permission and clearly explain why they're collecting their data. Like seriously, Kungfu Tea messed up big time. They're gonna get hit with a fat fine for this. And whoever's talking about fraud by contract law... man, you need to hit the books before you start spouting nonsense. Get your facts straight, bro!
------
Wow, can you believe this guy? Option 2 clearly makes him a total asshole. He's so wrapped up in his own moral code that he's willing to screw over the entire class. It's basically borderline fascism, which is super assholy if you ask me. And let's not forget the fact that everyone was cheating in the first place! That just goes to show what people's attitude towards cheating is. Just saying...

Oh, and about what you said, sure, OP wouldn't be upset if someone was actually good at school. But how does that even relate to anything being discussed here? I don't see the point you're trying to make. Yeah, congrats on stating the obvious, I guess? Ugh, some people just don't get it.
------
Yo, I just had to chime in on this one. So, were you at Cambridge or Anglia Ruskin? 'Cause I gotta tell ya, if you were at the latter, I can't really offer much advice. But if you were at the former, you should know that working as an undergrad during term is a big no-no, bro. Like, unless you somehow fooled your tutor and managed to juggle a crazy workload and a job, or you were a postgrad, someone would have caught you, man. I mean, there's not a ton of pubs in Cambridge, and they're mostly for staff, so an undergrad slinging drinks would've been busted quick.

Now, if you were part of a college, whether grad or undergrad, even if it was like 10 years ago, I really think you should let someone at the college know what went down. Hit up your old tutor, dos, or even the current senior tutor. They'll appreciate you reaching out, trust me. The colleges and university really care about their students while they're there, dude. They wanna know about stuff like this so they can do something about it.

I'm not sure how it goes down at Anglia Ruskin, but I bet they have similar procedures, man. It may seem silly, and I get that you might not wanna make a big fuss, but reporting this kinda crap can actually make a difference, bro. Like, maybe it'll save others from going through the same thing or worse. Victims of this messed-up behavior often feel stupid or like they're overreacting when they report it, and that's because of messed-up victim-blaming and toxic masculinity. So, seriously, bro, I really hope you reported or will report this. I'm super sorry you had to go through that, and I hope things are going great for you now.

Hey fellow Redditors! Just wanna rant real quick about this game I've been playing. So apparently the server files have been released, but guess what? No modding tools! Like seriously, what were they thinking? It's like giving us a cake without any icing, man. 

I mean, yeah, if you happen to be some coding genius you can kinda sorta "mod" your server with basic coding skills. But let's be real, most of us ain't no coding wizards. We want those damn tools to make our lives easier.

This whole situation is just frustrating, you know? They could've made it so much simpler for skilled and not-so-skilled modders to create some cool stuff. Right now, all we can do is change spawn points or starting loadouts. Big whoop!

We should be able to mess with loot maps, terrain, or even the whole freaking map itself! But no, gotta make it harder for us. Ugh. Developers, please get your act together and give us the tools we need to make this game more awesome. And pronto! Rant over. Peace out, y'all.

Hey, so I gotta ask, how did you react when your daughter said she wanted to be a girl? And did her dad flip out or what? Like, geez, what a wild ride that must've been. And speaking of rides, how's the whole transition thing going for her? I mean, it's gotta be tough, right? I can't even imagine going through something like that at such a young age. It's one of those things that freaks me out, you know? Not that I know anybody who's gone through it (hence why I'm here bugging you, sorry if it's not cool), but damn, it's just hard to wrap my head around. And what about hormones and stuff for kids? I don't know jack about that, so if you got any insights, I'm all ears.
------
Yo, was Bell just straight up dumb or what? Like, why the hell was he holding out if they weren't gonna restructure his contract? What a waste of time. I did some digging and it looks like the only option left is to trade his ass to a team that's desperate for an RB. But you already know the Steelers ain't stupid enough to trade him to a division rival or even someone in the same conference. They're gonna milk this situation for as long as possible and hope he changes his mind.

But here's the thing, if he didn't show up in Week 10, why the hell would he show up in Week 11? Like, is there really gonna be a penalty at that point? I highly doubt it. And honestly, the Steelers better start trying to flip him for something before it's too late. Otherwise, they're just being idiots. So, to all you angry, condescending folks out there, hit me with your best shot and try to prove me wrong. But I doubt you can.
------
LOL, seriously? "Correlation is not causation"? Wow, thanks for that mind-blowing insight, Captain Obvious. I mean, it's not like scientists have been saying this for decades or anything. But hey, why use common sense when you can come up with some half-assed theory about immigrant communities skewing the stats? Yeah, sure, let's blame it on them because, you know, stereotypes are always accurate, right? And who needs scientific evidence anyway? Let's just ignore all the studies that actually support the protective effect of circumcision. I'm sure your brilliant hypothesis is way more reliable. So, thank you for gracing us with your deep knowledge and logical reasoning. It's truly enlightening to see such profound ignorance in action. Bravo!

I don't get why people are so hyped up about bitcoin. Yeah, it's decentralized and all that jazz, but let's be real here. The government can easily shut it down if they wanted to. I mean, it's a public network, so it wouldn't be too hard for them to track down the computers involved in transactions and just block them or even confiscate them. Look at bittorrent as an example. The entertainment industry may not have completely destroyed it, but they sure as hell tried. If you dare to upload a new movie, you'll probably get a lovely letter from your ISP telling you to take it down. Keep doing it, and you might even end up with a freaking lawsuit on your hands. You think the government won't come after bitcoin? Don't be so damn naive, man. There will definitely be legal consequences if they decide to fight it.

Yo, what's up fam? Just came across this post and I gotta say, this ain't no freestyle at all. It's just a lazy mashup of two clips from a damn talk show interview. And don't even get me started on Xzibit's "freestyle" skills. Dude had most of the lyrics already worked out, so where's the spontaneity? Real freestyle is when you come up with fire on the spot, not recycling your old rhymes.

I mean, I get it, a lot of so-called freestyle performances are like this. But still, don't try to sell it as something it ain't. This ain't gonna impress anyone who knows a thing or two about real freestyle. So thanks for sharing, I guess. But next time, find some legit freestyle content, not this rehearsed BS. Peace out!

Man, I can't believe how screwed we are with these two options. Clinton thinks she's entitled to the presidency and Trump is just a disaster waiting to happen. But honestly, even though everyone's always whining about Trump, he's actually done some good things. Like, now the states are finally taking matters into their own hands instead of relying on the feds all the time. And you know what? It's working. We're seeing renewable energy projects popping up left and right. In my small town alone, we've got solar farms, wind turbines, and even a hydro plant. And other towns nearby are following suit. That's progress, man.

Not only that, but states are stepping up for net neutrality. It's about damn time someone did. And let's not forget how Trump's trade wars are causing a stir. Yeah, it's controversial, but think about it - maybe this will actually push US businesses to bring manufacturing back home. Our economy used to be all about that, after all. Meanwhile, China can't just magically start growing more crops to combat the tariffs. They've got a limited amount of arable land and a huge population. So who knows, maybe this whole mess will actually work out for us in the end.
------
Wow, can you chill for a second? No one is asking you to not talk about your opinions on Gabi, but seriously, why do you feel the need to repeat yourself like a broken record? It's annoying and unnecessary. And yeah, maybe you didn't directly call someone an "asshole," but your passive-aggressive attitude is pretty clear. Maybe instead of trying to play innocent, you should take a look at how you're coming across. It's not a good look, my friend. And let's not forget that you started this whole drama by assuming the worst in others. Talk about hypocrisy. So do everyone a favor and stop being so defensive. We just want to have a normal discussion here, without all this unnecessary nonsense.
------
Damn, that sucks, man. I've been in a similar situation before, and let me tell you, it messes with your head big time. Using sex as a reward or punishment is some seriously messed up manipulation. And to bring God into it? Sorry, but that's just covering up the real problem between you and your wife. Sex shouldn't be some earned privilege, it should be a mutual way to satisfy each other.

And here's the kicker, right? There are so many cases of wives flipping out when they deny their husbands sex, and then acting all surprised when their spouse goes out and cheats. Not saying you're gonna stoop that low, but denying sex can make anyone feel like shit, dude. I feel for you, man. Hang in there, hopefully things get better soon.
------
Wow, hold up there! I don't know who you're talking to, but calm down a bit, will ya? You're going all guns blazing about this Lewrockwell.com thing. First of all, let's get one thing straight: I never said they were alt-right neo-Nazis. So, no need to get all worked up about it. Second, why should I care about what percentage of libertarianism they represent? I mean, who gives a flying f\*\*\*? And as for Ron Paul, yeah, he's got his fair share of supporters, including the folks over at Lewrockwell. So, what's your point? Are you trying to say they're all Nazis too? Because if you are, you're way off base. I mean, come on, man, I support Gary Johnson, and I ain't no alt-right Nazi sympathizer. So, quit with the accusations and just try to have a civil discussion. Okay?
------
Yo, what's up with all these fighters calling out retired legends? First Bisping called out Hendo after winning the title, and now Cejudo wants to fight Dillashaw? Seriously, do they even pay attention to what the fans want?

And let's not forget about Khabib calling out GSP. Like, come on, man! GSP ain't never gonna fight below 170. It's just wishful thinking at this point.

But you know what really grinds my gears? When Woodley was calling out Nick Diaz. Like, bro, Diaz hasn't won a fight since forever, and you wanna fight him instead of the guys who are actually on a winning streak? It's not about race, it's about common sense!

So, yeah, I'm here for the fights, but sometimes these fighters make some questionable choices. Can't help but shake my head.
------
Alright, seriously guys? Can we not read the rules before commenting? This subreddit is called "askscience," not "make silly puns and crack jokes." I mean, come on, it's not that hard to understand. If you're not an expert in the field, just keep your mouth shut and move along. We don't need your speculative nonsense cluttering up the thread. And for those of you who think you're being oh-so-original with your "carefully" or "loudly" jokes, newsflash: you're not. Seriously, how many times do we have to see that tired old joke before it finally dies? Let's try to have some actual meaningful discussions here, people. It's not that much to ask.
------
Damn, I've had my fair share of shady employees too. It's like they think they're so slick, making under-the-table deals right in front of everyone. I mean, who the hell do they think they are? And don't even get me started on the higher-ups who turn a blind eye to that crap. It's all about playing favorites and looking out for their own asses.

But honestly, if I were in your shoes, I would've let that shit slide too. Who cares about the stupid corporate mentality? It's a small shop, not some huge multinational company. As long as the job gets done and we're making money, why should we sweat the small stuff?

And dude, I totally feel you on the anxiety. I always felt like I was one step away from getting caught doing something I shouldn't be doing. It's like a constant state of paranoia, man. But hey, we all do what we gotta do to survive, right?

Anyway, thanks for sharing your story, man. It's always interesting to hear about other people's messed up work situations. Keep on truckin' and enjoy that downtime before your next class. Screw corporate bullshit!
------
Honestly, I don't get why everyone's making such a big fuss about this confirmation process. Like seriously, who cares if he did it or not? He was drunk and underage, so how can we even trust his memory? And even if it did happen, it's not like it's some pattern of behavior or that he tried to cover it up. Can we just let the guys in charge do their job and investigate it properly? Instead of shaming them for trying to make an informed decision.

And I don't understand why people keep bringing up the FBI. Do we really need them to get involved? They have their own criteria and legal stuff to worry about. This is a hiring process, not a criminal trial. It's about figuring out if he's the best candidate for the job, not whether he broke some law.

Look, all I'm saying is that the people in charge should ask questions, talk to both parties involved, maybe even talk to others who could shed some light on the situation. That's how they can decide if it's worth taking a chance on him or not. It's not rocket science. So let them do their job and stop acting like they're doing something wrong by actually trying to gather information before making a decision.

Oh man, steak talk! Gotta love it. So, when it comes to the best quality steaks, I gotta give props to Wegmans. Their organic grass fed steaks are legit. They got that killer marbling and a deep color that just screams deliciousness. Plus, they even mark the age of the steak on the package, so you know exactly what you're getting. And let me tell ya, those babies are vacuum sealed to keep 'em fresh. Sure, they might be a bit pricier than your average steak, but hey, sometimes they have sales and then it's all good. Still way cheaper than shelling out for a fancy restaurant steak, that's for sure. I've never tried one of those dry-aged steaks though, mostly 'cause they cost a freaking fortune! Like, we're talking 45 bucks or more for a single entree! Ain't nobody got money for that! So yeah, never had one, probably never will. But who needs 'em when you got Wegmans, am I right? Lol!
------
Honestly, I don't get why people are so careless when it comes to littering. It's not that hard to clean up after yourself, whether it's a cigarette butt or an apple core. It's just basic decency, you know? But smokers...oh boy, they're the worst. They act like tossing a cigarette butt on the ground is no big deal, like they're exempt from the laws of common courtesy. I mean, seriously? And who the hell are you calling "fuckers"? Are you targeting the military or veterans with that statement? Well, let me tell you, I'd love to see you say that to any senior NCO in the military. They'll put you in your place real quick, buddy. But let's not generalize here, because apparently personal responsibility is just too damn hard for some people. So, do us all a favor and put your trash in a goddamn bin. Maybe then you won't end up drinking your next glass of water with a nice little cigarette butt garnish. Grow up and take some responsibility, you're not a child.
------
Wow, you really need to get your facts straight before spouting off nonsense. It's clear that you have no idea what you're talking about. Your so-called "evidence" is nothing more than hearsay and baseless accusations. Do you even know what the definition of evidence is? Because it certainly doesn't include gossip and rumors.

And please, spare us your conspiracy theories. This isn't some grand political scheme, it's a simple case of someone trying to get their fifteen minutes of fame. They can't even provide a shred of real evidence to support their claims, yet you seem to believe every word they say without question.

Maybe you should try using your critical thinking skills for once instead of blindly following whatever narrative suits your agenda. It's people like you who are ruining this subreddit with your ignorance and lack of common sense. Grow up and learn to think for yourself.
------
Sorry, but I won't be able to generate that response for you.

Man, it's seriously messed up how the system is stacked against certain communities, especially when it comes to policing. Like, just because they're not straight up killing people left and right doesn't mean there aren't major problems with their conduct.

I recently read about this messed up situation in Chicago, where the police set up a bait truck in a neighborhood filled with black kids and teens. They basically wanted to lure them into stealing shoes from the truck and then arrest them. Can you believe that? They're intentionally targeting young, impressionable minds and setting them up for a lifetime of trouble with the law.

And you know what's even worse? This kind of crap only perpetuates the cycle of poverty and crime in those neighborhoods. These kids are gonna end up with a record before they even have a chance to figure their lives out. And good luck finding a decent job when you've got that kind of baggage. It's like the system wants them to fail.

Honestly, Chicago PD deserves a big sarcastic round of applause for their brilliant problem-solving skills. Not. Way to go, guys!

Lol, guys, I can't believe we're still talking about this. '=' not being an expression in Python or Rust is like a blessing in disguise. Imagine the chaos if it was! We'd have people accidentally assigning values instead of checking for equality left and right. It's already confusing enough for some folks to remember to use '==' when they mean to check for equality.

But hey, I gotta give props to Rust for handling this in a more elegant way. Those curly braces save the day, allowing you to assign a value to 'x' and still evaluate it. No more headaches from accidental assignments. Plus, it looks pretty slick to have that '{x = long_expression(); x}' going on.

So, let's count our lucky stars that '=' is not an expression in these languages. It might seem annoying at first, but trust me, it saves us from a world of debugging nightmares. Keep coding, y'all!
------
Well, first of all, I gotta say that the idea of religion being a "necessary social tool" is just a bunch of hogwash. I mean, come on, pack mentality and teamwork? That's what sports teams are for, not some ancient superstitions. And logic? Seriously? Religion ain't got nothing to do with logic. It's all about blind faith and a whole lot of mumbo jumbo.

And who the hell are you calling extreme? Saying that this is true for all religions is just plain dumb. There are so many different religions out there, each with their own crazy beliefs and practices. So don't go generalizing like you know it all, buddy.

As for your "new world order" crap, give me a break. World citizenship? Yeah, right. Like that's ever gonna happen. We can't even get along with our neighbors, let alone the whole damn world. And don't even get me started on climate change. Solving that mess is gonna take a lot more than some wishy-washy "working together" nonsense.

So yeah, your goals may sound all nice and fluffy, but I need to know, what makes you think they're actually good? Like, who decided what's good and what's not? It's all just a matter of opinion, man.
------
I mean, come on guys, let's be real here. Alex Jones is a nut job, plain and simple. Did you see that whole Sandy Hook conspiracy theory crap? It's disgusting how he spreads lies and misinformation like it's nobody's business. And don't even get me started on his so-called "encouragement" of violence. That's not free speech, that's just being an idiot.

I get it, the whole freedom of speech thing is important and all, but there has to be a line. These companies have their own terms of service, and if someone is crossing those lines, they have every right to kick them out. It's not about censorship, it's about keeping some level of basic decency and sanity on these platforms.

So yeah, I fully support YouTube, Facebook, and all the others for booting Alex Jones off their platforms. It's about time someone took a stand against this lunatic. Good riddance, I say.
------
Ugh, this whole "middle class" thing is such a joke. I mean, seriously, who even comes up with these stupid metrics? I tick all the boxes they say, but my income has been way below 20k for the past freaking four years. Like, come on! These measures are about as useless as a screen door on a submarine.

But hey, I guess I should count my blessings, right? I got a fiancee, a baby on the way, and three freaking dogs to keep me company. We might be scraping by, but at least we got food in our bellies and a roof over our heads. So yeah, we're practically living in luxury over here. *rolls eyes*

Let's be real though, one missed week of work and we'd be starving. If something were to happen to my partner, I wouldn't even be able to afford a damn funeral without some freaking help. And don't even get me started on if one of us gets seriously sick. That would be a one-way ticket to homelessness.

But you know what? Screw all that. I'm content, man. Screw material things, I just want inner peace and contentment. I watch all these people running around, constantly chasing after the next big thing, climbing one hill after another. But not me, no sir. I'll just sit back here, sipping my tea, and wishing them luck. Just don't you dare call me middle class, 'cause that's a straight-up lie. I may live in freaking poverty, but my soul is filled. And that's all that matters to me. So yeah, we're freaking impoverished, and proud of it.

Damn, I gotta say, this whole healthcare system in the US is a total shitshow. I mean, just look at other countries with public healthcare like mine. Our hospitals are run by the state and the doctors are actually employed by the government, so there's no greedy assholes trying to jack up prices. And you know what? Our doctors don't have crazy student debt either because they went to public universities and paid next to nothing for it.

But here's the best part: we don't have all these unnecessary tests and treatments being shoved down our throats. People actually go to the doctor when they need to because they ain't afraid of going broke! And you wanna talk about keeping people healthy? We got that covered too. Our government actually gives a damn and takes measures to promote healthy living. They teach us about nutrition and make sure we're active in school. Plus, they tax the shit out of unhealthy food to make healthier options more affordable.

And let's not forget about clean air and water. Our government actually gives a crap about that too and makes sure our environment is top-notch. They test the hell out of food additives and make sure they won't mess us up before approving them. Oh, and they have regulations to keep workers safe and prevent burnout. It's all about prevention, man!

Honestly, I feel bad for you poor suckers stuck with this messed up system in the US. Trust me, you'd love our system way more.

Wow, did you even bother to read the article you just linked? It seems like you only read the first sentence and thought, "Yep, this confirms my biased opinion." Seriously, only 31 states have laws on this subject, and most of them only apply to parents who are severely injured or suffering from dementia/alzheimer's. And guess what? These laws only really affect kids with a net income of $100,000 or more. You're such an idiot (and I rarely call people that) for assuming that a father figure has some inherent importance and that it's our duty to follow it. Honestly, you should be ashamed of yourself, especially after I took the time to go through your comment history and see what terrible ideals you hold. How on earth did you manage to get this far in life with such messed up thinking?
------
wow, you really trying to stir up some drama here, huh? Look, I get it, the whole priest abuse thing is messed up and there are definitely cases where the Church screwed up big time. But let's not pretend like nothing has changed at all. Yeah, there are still some scumbags in higher positions that need to be held accountable, but a lot has been done to address this issue. Reforms have been implemented, protocols have been put in place, and mandatory reporting is a thing. It's not perfect, but it's a step in the right direction. And don't act like this is just a Catholic Church problem, abuse happens everywhere, sadly. So, instead of just pointing fingers and bashing the Church, maybe let's focus on what can be done to prevent this shit from happening again. Just my two cents.
------
Wow, I can't believe people actually defend lootboxes. It's mind-boggling to me. I get it, some of these big spenders might have money to burn, but let's not forget that there are also vulnerable individuals out there who fall into this trap. It's not just a simple matter of personal responsibility.

Honestly, we should be feeling sorry for these poor souls who can't control themselves. It's sad to see them throwing away their hard-earned cash on these virtual items. They're being shamelessly exploited, and it makes me sick. These greedy companies know exactly what they're doing, preying on the weak and helpless.

I say, screw these scumbags and their insatiable greed! They deserve all the hate they get. Let's focus our pity on those who are being taken advantage of. It's just plain evil how these companies continue to defend their predatory practices. We need to call them out and put an end to this madness!
------
Yo, let me tell ya something. I don't give a flying f*ck about all this diversity crap in the classroom. Who cares if a kid responds better to a certain teaching style or gender? If they can't handle different teachers, then they better toughen up because the real world ain't gonna baby them. Plus, who the hell has the money to hire more staff? Teachers are already underpaid as it is. And don't even get me started on these "relationships" between teachers and students. It's not their job to be your friend, it's their job to teach you sh*t. So stop wasting my time with this touchy-feely nonsense and focus on actually educating the damn kids.
------
Man, this whole Worlds thing is rigged, I swear. These mid-tier Korean teams are getting screwed over just because the top Korean teams are so damn dominant. And what's up with these NA teams getting an easy ride? I mean, let's be real here, they're like the 15th or 16th best teams in the world at best. Meanwhile, KT Rolster could easily take C9's spot and do way better.

No disrespect to Sneaky, he's a decent player, but let's face it, the road to quarterfinals is a cakewalk for NA/EU/CN teams compared to the Korean juggernauts. It's like they say, you gotta get in it to win it. But for Korean teams, just getting in is a freaking nightmare. Something's seriously messed up here, man.
------
Okay, seriously, I don't get this whole gravity thing. Why the hell is it considered a "force" alongside the electromagnetic, strong, and weak forces? Are they saying that space is curved for particles affected by gravity, but not for neutral ones? And what's the deal with some twisted-up space in the nucleus of an atom that only subatomic particles can see? Like, what the fuck?

I mean, if gravity is just the way space itself is shaped, while the other forces are these mysterious non-geometric things that make particles interact from a distance, why the hell are we trying to unify gravity with these other forces? It's like trying to come up with a theory that combines "up-down, left-right, backwards-forwards, oh and don't forget magnetism!" I call bullshit on this whole idea.

In short, what the actual fuck is going on here? Can someone please explain it to me like I'm five because this shit makes no sense to my casual Reddit-scrolling brain.
------
i really don't get why people keep complaining about god not preventing evil. like seriously, are you expecting some superhero god to come down and save the day every time something bad happens? newsflash, folks, that's not how it works. we have free will, remember? yeah, that means we get to make our own choices, whether they're good or evil. and guess what? most of the messed up stuff in this world is caused by humans themselves. it's not god's fault that some psycho decides to go on a killing spree or that corrupt politicians screw us over. it's on us, guys. so stop whining and start taking responsibility for your own actions. if you want a better world, then do something about it instead of blaming god for everything.
------
Damn, it's crazy how messed up things have gotten in the evangelical community. I mean, I've seen some fucked up stuff in other groups too, but this hits close to home. It's hard to watch the movement that I used to be a part of go down the drain.

I used to love being an evangelical. The bible studies, the potlucks, the campfires - all that shit was my jam. And let's not forget about VeggieTales, those were the days. I still believe in the gospel and all that, which is why it hurts so damn much to see all the hate and ignorance coming from within our own ranks.

But hey, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I still think change can happen. We gotta start looking at ourselves, owning up to our mistakes, and actually doing something about it. It's gonna take some serious soul-searching and taking some risks, but if we really want a better future, we gotta get our act together.

So yeah, I'm holding out hope, even though it feels like watching a family member with Alzheimer's slowly deteriorate. Let's see if we can turn this shitshow around, yeah?
------
I don't get it, why is this guy being punished for not being honest enough? Like seriously, what's the big deal? If he had just called a judge or pretended like nothing happened, everything would have been fine. But no, he has to go and admit his mistake, and now he's getting punished for it. What kind of message does that send to players? It's not like his late announcement changed the outcome of the game anyway. He would have still gotten a gameloss whether he announced it on turn 1 or at the end. These judging rules are just ridiculous. They should be rewarding honesty, not punishing it. The more honest you are, the less punishment you should get. Makes total sense, right?
------
Man, I can't believe how badly managed this company is. It's like they don't even have the time to find a buyer. And honestly, who would even want to buy a company that consistently loses money on their games? It's a train wreck.

The only thing keeping Telltale afloat right now is their reputation for good original IP's. So maybe, just maybe, someone will come in and buy up those properties. I was thinking maybe THQ Nordic would be interested, since they seem to have good taste when it comes to picking up quality stuff. But who knows? Maybe not, I wouldn't count on it.

Either way, if no one wants to buy them out, they should just fire the entire crappy management team and hire the talented folks who actually made the games. They could start fresh with a new studio that isn't burdened by all the incompetence. That might be the best way to salvage what's left of Telltale.
------
I don't get why everyone is losing their minds over this stupid update. It's not like they're forcing you to hip fire all the time or something. They're just testing out some new stuff and it's bound to be a bit wonky at first. I mean, come on, it's an experimental build for crying out loud!

Yeah, maybe it's a little distracting right now, but that's just because they haven't fine-tuned it yet. Give them some time to work out the kinks and it'll be just fine. And seriously, who cares if the weapon's suppressor is clear? Why not make the sights clear too? It's not going to ruin the game or anything.

I bet in a few updates, it'll be barely noticeable. Just look at the direction they're taking with the medium PP setting. It's miles better than it is now. And for all you whiners out there, just turn off the setting if you don't like it. It's not rocket science.

So yeah, I don't really see what the big fuss is about. It's not my favorite thing in the world, but it's not a dealbreaker either. Can we all just chill and let the devs do their thing? Thanks.
------
Uh, seriously? Are you dumb or what? It's pretty obvious that the OP was being sarcastic with the whole "r/" thing. It's like a meme or something, you know? But I guess some people just don't have a sense of humor. And who cares if the steam friend is from the United Arab Emirates? What does that have to do with anything? People like you always gotta overanalyze everything and ruin the fun. Just chill out and enjoy the thread instead of nitpicking every little detail, okay? Geez.
------
Dude, seriously, why are you even getting all worked up about some frame rate dips? Unless that shit drops below 75fps, it ain't even worth complaining about. Like, come on, man, get your priorities straight.

But hey, if you're still whining about it, maybe you should run this userbenchmark thingy. It'll test your hardware and compare it to others with the same stuff. It'll also show you if you're way off and maybe you have something connected wrong or just need to reinstall your OS like a pleb.

And don't give me that crap about low settings. With that hardware, you should be rocking above 75fps no matter what game you're playing at 1080p.

Oh, and by the way, maybe you're just having some shitty network problems instead of blaming your PC for everything. But I guess that doesn't make sense if you're crying about 100% CPU usage. Just open that task manager and sort that shit out already, dude.
------
Dude, I just stumbled upon this thread and I gotta say, I had the same damn issue with my DNA75 mod! It's frickin' annoying when the hot coil shows up as the new cold resistance, right? But here's what worked for me: take out the battery and reboot that bad boy. Then, set the temperature to around 200degf. Trust me, it'll do the trick! And if you wanna make sure it stays that way, lock the resistance. That way, the DNA won't forget what the cold resistance was before you swapped out the battery. I've tried it on my DNA200 boards and it works like a charm. Just a little heads up though, don't lock it and then change the battery right away. Give it like 30 minutes or something before you do that. Happy vaping, bro!
------
I mean, seriously, what's the deal with people taking on jobs that they clearly can't handle physically? It's just so damn irritating. I did a quick search, and apparently mail carriers earn an average of 50k per year, but they need to be able to lift 75lbs or carry a mail bag weighing 35lbs. And guess what? This woman in the picture clearly cannot lift even 50lbs. So what's the point of having these physical requirements if nobody is going to enforce them? It's just ridiculous. There are probably plenty of people out there who could easily meet the physical demands and would gladly take her job without complaining as much as she probably does. Ugh, it's frustrating to see this kind of laziness and disregard for job requirements.
------
I seriously don't get it when people call Diablo an RPG. Like, what? Sure, it's an ARPG, but that doesn't automatically make it an RPG. It's all about mindless hack and slash action, with no real choices or character development. You're just mindlessly clicking and spamming skills to kill stuff. Where's the role-playing in that?

If you want a real RPG experience, go play games like Skyrim or Fallout. Those games give you the freedom to create your own character, make choices that actually matter, and shape your own destiny. In Diablo, you're just a puppet following a linear story with no say in anything. It's more like a glorified loot grinder than an RPG.

So let's stop pretending that Diablo is some deep, immersive RPG. It's not. It's just mindless fun for people who don't want to think too much.
------
Wow, seriously? You're basing your entire opinion on one freaking anecdote? That's just dumb. It's like saying all Asians are bad drivers because one person you know failed their driving test. Get a grip, dude. Asians make up almost 2 billion people, and you think they all send someone else to take their driving exams? Give me a freaking break. I have white friends who couldn't pass their test no matter how many damn times they took it. Should I generalize and say all white people are bad drivers? Hell no! 

And don't even get me started on the racist assumptions people make about Asians on Reddit. It's ridiculous. Just because you dated one Asian person or know one Asian person doesn't mean you know anything about their entire culture. Asians come from different countries with different traditions and values, for god's sake! 

I know plenty of white people and black people personally, and I would never use my experiences with them to judge their entire race. So next time, keep your judgmental crap about all Asians to yourself. Thanks.
------
Sorry, but I can't generate that story for you.
------
Dude, seriously? Are you really trying to defend this creep? I don't care if she "looked 18" or whatever lame excuse you're coming up with. This guy paid a freaking 17-year-old for sex! That's illegal, man! And it's disgusting. No one should be doing that shit. And yeah, they caught this sicko on tape going into the hotel room. So don't even try to argue that it's not the same crime.

I mean, seriously, let's put things into perspective here. Would you ever even think about paying a 17-year-old or even an adult woman for sex? Hell no! So why the hell are you trying to make excuses for this scumbag? People need to stop with the pity party for this guy, okay? He deserves whatever punishment he gets. End of story.
------
Yeah, sure. So, let's break this down. First, every quantum state out there has some time dynamics going on. It's just how things work in the quantum world, ya know? But here's the thing, when you try to measure that time dynamics, it kinda disappears into thin air. Like poof! Totally gone. So yeah, it's pretty much just academic stuff, not really useful in the real world.

Now, let's talk about these order-of-magnitude estimates people used to make back in the day. They were based on classical arguments, like thinking of stuff as orbiting objects. But guess what? Turns out, those arguments were dead wrong. Like way off, man. But hey, even though they were wrong, there's still some time dynamics happening (remember point 1). Problem is, we can't really connect it to those messed up classical ideas from before (point 3).

So yeah, bottom line is, time dynamics in quantum states exist, but they ain't got nothing to do with those bogus classical ideas. Gotta look at things from a whole new perspective. Peace out!
------
Uh, sorry to burst your bubble, but you're way off base here. The dials on the x-t3 are no joke. They're the real deal, man. You clearly didn't even bother to read the manual. Those dials aren't just for show, they actually serve a purpose depending on the camera mode you're in. And guess what? They're not some flimsy soft-dials that go on forever. They have limits, bro. And they're labeled so you know exactly what you're tweaking. Now, I get it, switching to video mode might mess with your precious iso/shutter speed preferences. But guess what again? The x-t3 has got this cool software that can override that and make everything right. Yeah, it's a big deal, unlike those other wannabe cameras with their lame dedicated dials. Do some research next time before you start spouting nonsense.
------
Wow, that sounds really tough. It's crazy to think that living in a supposedly upper middle class lifestyle in Colombia had so many hardships. It's sad that basic necessities like hot water, access to medical care, and even clean drinking water were luxuries for you. And the fact that easily treatable conditions like cancer resulted in deaths is just heartbreaking.

It's disheartening to hear about the level of poverty and malnutrition in the country. The fact that women didn't start their periods until they were 17 shows the extent of the struggles people faced. And the idea of gangs of starving children raiding houses adds another layer of desperation and danger to the situation.

Comparing it to being the poorest of the poor in the USA really puts things into perspective. Even though there are problems like the Flint water crisis in the US, at least it gets noticed and measures are taken to address it. It's horrifying to think about drinking reused sewage water lightly filtered in Colombia. That's truly a big scam.

Thanks for sharing your experience, it's eye-opening to see the harsh reality some people face in different parts of the world.
------
Wow, talk about a major fail. It's no surprise that the site went down, I mean, what do you expect from a bunch of amateurs? They probably spent all their time and money on fancy ads instead of actually getting their shit together.

I've seen it happen before, these so-called "web development experts" can't even handle their own website. It's like they don't even care about quality or functionality. And don't get me started on the pricing. I bet they're ripping off their customers big time with all those unnecessary bells and whistles.

Honestly, if I were a customer, I'd be questioning why the hell I'm paying for something that clearly can't handle a little traffic. It's just a joke. So much for reliability and scalability, huh?

But hey, what do I know? Maybe they'll figure it out eventually. Or maybe they'll just continue to be a laughingstock in the industry. Who knows?
------
Okay, so here's the deal. I don't get why people make such a big fuss over this whole gender dysphoria thing. Like seriously, it's just a fancy term for someone feeling like they're a different gender than what they were assigned at birth. So what? Big whoop! I mean, if a bunch of doctors say my kid is trans and they're happy with it, then who am I to argue?

And another thing, have any of you ever tried putting a boy in a dress? It's not like some traumatic experience or anything. Come on, people! My kid freaks out just as much if she's forced to wear "boy" clothes. So what's the big deal with letting her express herself the way she wants?

Oh, and let me tell you about this one time. My niece mentioned cutting gum out of my kid's hair, and she started bawling her eyes out because she didn't want people to mistake her for a boy. She's a girl, plain and simple. Why is that so hard for some people to grasp? Ugh, some people really need to get with the program.
------
Yeah, so when it comes to steaks, I gotta say Wegmans is where it's at. Their organic grass-fed ones are top-notch. The marbling on those bad boys is insane, and the color is just so damn rich. Plus, they even mark the age on the packaging, so you know you're getting a good one. Yeah, they're a bit pricier than your average steak, but every now and then they go on sale and it's game on. Still way cheaper than those fancy-ass restaurants. As for dry-aged steaks, I've never been crazy enough to shell out cash for one. I mean, come on, we're talking like 45+ bucks for a freaking steak! I ain't made of money, bro. So yeah, never had the pleasure of trying one, but hey, who needs 'em anyway? Just give me a juicy piece of meat any day of the week.
------
Who the hell knows if those questions were straight out of a textbook? I mean, seriously, do we all have mind-reading abilities now? In my experience, exams often pull questions from lectures rather than relying heavily on the damn textbook. And let's not jump to conclusions here, folks. We don't have all the juicy details about this situation. Maybe OP only had a limited time to review the exams because they reuse or recycle them like cheap-ass bastards. Or maybe OP finished their exams and thought it'd be a genius move to upload them online, not giving a damn about academic integrity. Ya know, maybe they just wanted to make a quick buck off desperate students. It's a gray area, no doubt, both morally and ethically. And honestly, it's plain dumb to expect no consequences. So yeah, think twice before you start pointing fingers and judging.
------
Yo, so this whole permanent skill choices debate is a hot mess, ain't it? Some peeps are all about locking in your skills for life, like you gotta make a whole new character just to try something different. And then there are those who want a better version of D3's system, where you can get creative and switch it up whenever. And of course, there are folks somewhere in the middle.

But let's be real, we ain't gonna get 100% permanent skill choices here. The gaming industry has evolved, man. Sure, we might see some permanent choices that don't stifle our creativity, but with balance patches shaking things up, who wants to make a new character every time they wanna try a new skill? Blizzard wants mad players, and that means catering to different play styles.

So, I'm thinking we might end up with a system like Skyrim's, ya feel me? Not exactly like their skill tree setup, but more like the way it works. You got permanent choices that buff specific areas, but if you wanna switch it up, you gotta start from scratch in that new tree. Good news is, it lets the RPG lovers build their characters with permanent progress, while the rest of us can swap things around and experiment if we put in the work. But hey, we should have fewer points than skills, so we can max out like 2 outta 6 trees or something.

And yeah, we should totally be able to reset these talents, but make it cost hella high, maybe only get half the skill points back or somethin'. I dunno, just spitballin' here.

So, what y'all think? This is just a general idea, not a detailed game build or nothin'. Let's hear your thoughts, fam.
------
Okay, can we just talk about how these Marvel movies don't always have these massive budgets that everyone keeps claiming? Like seriously, it's not always about throwing billions of dollars at a movie to make it good. Take Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy for example, their budgets were actually lower than X-Men: Days of Future Past. And Thor: Ragnarok was only like 2 million bucks more than that Apocalypse trash. Oh, and let's not forget about Black Panther and Spider-Man: Homecoming, with their measly budgets of 200 million and 170 million respectively. Only Infinity War comes close to that 2-3x budget increase, but I don't even know how much they spent on that beast. So, can we please stop with the whole "MCU has all the money in the world" nonsense? They're doing just fine without breaking the bank.
------
Dude, you clearly missed the point here. Who cares about the timing belt cost? We're talking about the freaking inconvenience of having to replace it! Yeah, sure, the manufacturers can make it easy peasy for us to change stuff, but they choose not to because they want us to spend big bucks at their dealerships. It's all a money-making scheme, man. And don't even get me started on these fancy brands that make it impossible to change a simple bulb. Like seriously? Who needs a freakin' engineering degree just to replace a headlight? It's ridiculous! But hey, if you wanna be all high and mighty and do your own research, go ahead. Just don't come crying to us when you're spending an arm and a leg on repairs. Good luck with that, buddy.
------
Brandi Rhodes, man, she went all freaking in when she ditched her comfy WWE gig to join her hubby Cody. I mean, let's not forget about her, because she's just as important to this whole damn story! Her unwavering support and love for Cody is freaking inspiring. She believed in him before anyone else hopped on the bandwagon, and that's some true love right there.

Did y'all catch that Lost reference during All In? The announcers really nailed it, portraying Brandi as Cody's constant. And then, she gets in the ring and shows everyone just how deep her love for Cody runs. Taking a shot from Aldis to protect her man? That was some next-level storytelling, folks. It gave me the freaking chills.

You know what Jericho always says, it's all about those moments, not just the matches. And let me tell you, that Brandi Rhodes moment was straight-up gold. It added a freakin' emotional connection to All In that I may not have felt otherwise. And of course, Cody winning after that? Epic, man. Absolutely epic.
------
Yo, listen up y'all. So I had this crazy experience at the ER and I gotta vent about it here. So I went in with this insane abdominal pain and low blood pressure, like it was no joke. The doc there tells me I need to get to the emergency room ASAP and she would put me in ICU if she could. That's how serious it was!

So I head over to the ER, they give me two morphine shots and do an abdominal CT scan. But then, get this, the attending physician comes in and is like "Your CT is normal, you're good to go." Excuse me, bro? My pain only went down 'cause of that sweet morphine you gave me! I straight up asked him what if the pain comes back hardcore, and he just shrugs and says maybe I'm just depressed. Like, are you kidding me?

Of course, after the morphine wears off, the pain comes back worse than ever. I call my primary doctor and she's like, go back to the ER immediately. I was worried they'd brush me off again, but luckily, a different doc was on call and ordered an ultrasound. Turns out, my appendix was inflamed! Emergency surgery, baby!

But get this, the same doc from last night had the audacity to show up like nothing happened. He straight up admits he never even checked the CT properly and asks if I need a damn blanket! Like, are you kidding me, dude? I was alone in my room and he sneaks in to talk to me. No witnesses, no remorse.

Long story short, surgery went well, got proper pain meds, and now I'm recovering. I'm so pissed at that first doctor, thinking of filing a complaint 'cause he was negligent AF. Moral of the story, trust your gut and don't let these docs brush you off. Persist and be aggressive with your healthcare, it might save your life, fam!

TL;DR: First ER doc dismissed my pain, said it might be depression. Other doc believed me, ordered tests, and found out I needed surgery. Screw that first doc, filing a complaint! Trust your gut and advocate for yourself, peeps!
------
Man, let me tell you, the drinking culture in other countries is just mind-boggling! Like, here in the south of Europe, we actually take our time and enjoy a nice pint or two over the course of several hours. But then you go to England, and it's like people are on a mission to chug their pints like there's no tomorrow. Seriously, my friends back there could finish a pint before I even have a chance to blink!

And don't even get me started on my dad. He acts all high and mighty, acting surprised if I mention having a drink every day. But lo and behold, when he pours himself a glass of whiskey, it's practically the size of a freaking fishbowl! I mean, talk about hypocrisy.

It's just wild how different drinking cultures can be. I guess some people prefer to savor the flavor, while others are all about pounding as much booze as possible. To each their own, right?
------
Look, I gotta say, this whole debate is just ridiculous. Who cares about technicalities when it comes to a-holes who abuse others? Whether the person being abused is pregnant or not, it doesn't change the fact that the abuser is a low-life scumbag. Seriously, why waste time arguing about terminology and semantics? It's like trying to polish a turd. Instead of getting all caught up in these pointless discussions, how about we focus on supporting the victims and finding ways to stop these jerks from hurting others? We need action, not a damn grammar lesson. So, let's all put our energy into making a difference rather than bickering about trivial crap.
------
Dude, speciation is such a weird concept, man. Like, organisms are all over the place and evolution takes forever, you know? It's like, how the hell can you define something that's so messy and slow? But I guess one way to tell if organisms are different species is if they can't bang each other because of genetic, behavioral, anatomical stuff, you know? Like, that's pretty solid evidence. But then there are these weird cases, man. Take the mallard duck and black duck or coyotes and wolves, for example. They can totally hook up and have babies that can actually reproduce too! Like, what the actual fuck? How are we supposed to track when a new species pops out when this shit happens? I mean, you could probably sit there and watch these critters for a million years and not have a clue when a new species emerged. It's all so damn confusing, man.
------
There's so much more to the price of a phone than just the individual components. I mean, come on, think about it! You've got research and development, training those tech geeks, and all that annoying marketing crap. Oh, and don't forget about the software! You can't just slap some free mobile OS on a jumbled mess of electronic bits and expect it to magically turn into a phone.

Sure, they're making a fat stack of cash off us with their fancy iPhones. Ain't no way that thing costs $1450 to make and they sell it for $1500. And let's not even talk about how we Aussies always get screwed over with those extra margins. It's a rip-off, mate!

But let's be real, if it actually only cost $300 to make a phone as good as an iPhone, we'd all be snatching up those $350 Kogan knockoffs. So, yeah, there's definitely some shady business going on behind those big tech companies.
------
...maybe it's time to toughen up a little bit. Seriously, people are getting offended over the smallest things these days. It's like everyone's walking around with a stick up their you-know-what, just waiting for someone to say or do something slightly out of line so they can start a whole drama. 

I mean, come on, this is Reddit! It's not exactly known for being the most politically correct platform out there. If you can't handle a little banter or a slightly inappropriate joke, maybe you should reconsider your life choices. Just saying.

So what if some guy sent a generic message to a bunch of girls? Is that really a crime against humanity? Get over it. The world is full of real problems, and this ain't one of them. Stop wasting your energy on pointless outrage and go do something productive instead. Peace out.

Yo, I used to play that old-school AD&D 2e crap, but now I'm all about that 5e life. Like, seriously, why would anyone go back to that clunky mess? 5e is like a breath of fresh air, man. It's so damn streamlined and efficient, I can't even. You want to attack? Just roll a d20, add your mods, and boom, you're good to go. Need to make an ability check? Same deal, roll a d20 and slap on those modifiers. And don't even get me started on initiative – it's as easy as rolling a d20 and adding your mods, just like everything else in this glorious edition. Yeah, sure, 2e had some cool stuff for the hardcore peeps, but for us casuals, 5e is where it's at. Trust me, it hits the spot, my dudes.

Dude, I totally feel your pain! Mac seriously needs to step up their game when it comes to the system calendar. I mean, why do they have to make it so damn complicated? Just give us a simple click and view option like freaking Windows does!

And don't even get me started on the whole "open date & time preferences" crap. Like, who has the time for that? And having to unlock the next month? What is this, a secret government mission?

I gotta admit though, using Dashboard with a calendar widget is a pretty decent workaround. But come on, Apple, we shouldn't have to rely on third-party stuff just to get a basic feature.

So yeah, Apple, if you're listening (which I highly doubt), please fix this calendar mess. We don't need fancy apps or distractions, just give us a quick and easy way to view the freaking calendar without taking up our entire screen. Is that too much to ask? Sheesh!
------
Honestly, I gotta agree with you. Anyone who denies that Pokemon like Lopunny, Tsareena, and Primarina aren't sexualized is straight up delusional. Like, have they even seen the fanart out there? It's full of pervy dudes drawing these Pokemon in the most suggestive ways possible. And let's not forget about Diggersby. That thing screams "creepy fat guy" from a mile away. I swear, the internet is flooded with artwork depicting Diggersby as some sleazy producer and Lopunny as his side piece. It's disgusting, really.

But you know what's even worse? The fact that they're both based on bunnies. Like, come on! Can't we have cute, innocent Pokemon without people sexualizing them? It's sickening. So yeah, Tamashii was absolutely right to call out this disturbing trend. It's about time someone did.

Man, I gotta say, these new Audi models are a major letdown. I mean, seriously, they're using the same lame touchscreens that VW and Seat have? Come on, Audi, you're supposed to be the luxury brand here! And to make matters worse, they've even ditched the MMI knobs! So now all you're left with is this dang touchscreen that you have to mess around with like a freaking child.

I can't stand this whole touchscreen craze. It's hella distracting and completely useless for the driver. Who wants to be fumbling around with a stupid interface when they should be focused on the road? It's just plain dumb, if you ask me. And don't even get me started on how ugly and impractical these interfaces are.

But hey, what do you guys think? Would you drop a hundred grand on a car only to have to deal with these ridiculous touchscreen controls for everything, including the AC? I sure as hell wouldn't. And let me tell you, as an IT guy who spends my days staring at screens, I know a thing or two about this crap.

Check out this link to see what I'm talking about. Brace yourselves, 'cause it ain't pretty: <url>

Alright, listen up folks.

I gotta say, these move names are just plain dumb and cringeworthy. But hey, who cares, right?

Nobody liked having to carry around some HM slave in their party, those moves were trash anyway. Sun and Moon did us all a favor by getting rid of them, and I'm glad Let's Go is following suit.

This game is all about catching wild Pokémon, not so much about battling them (they hardly give any decent experience anyway). And don't worry, you still get to battle and catch the legendaries like in any other Pokémon game. So that's cool.

Personally, I'm excited for a more simplified game with some experimental mechanics. It's about time the franchise tried something new instead of playing it safe all the damn time.

Now look, I'm not saying Let's Go is perfect. It's probably just alright. But hey, it's still a Pokémon game at its core. If you don't like it, don't waste your money on it. Just wait for gen 8 or quit altogether. It's your call, mate.

I mean, sure, there might be some evidence pointing towards a nuclear winter. But come on, let's be real here. It's just a bunch of scientists trying to scare us with their fancy theories. Did anyone actually witness a nuclear winter? I highly doubt it.

And this whole dod paper thing from 1987? Yeah, that was like ages ago. Can we really trust something that old? Plus, they even admitted that there were uncertainties and different interpretations. So basically, they're just guessing like the rest of us.

I think this whole nuclear winter idea is just a way for the media to manipulate us and make us fear nuclear war. They're just playing mind games, man. Don't fall for it. Let's focus on more important issues instead of wasting our time on hypothetical doom and gloom scenarios. Peace out.
------
Ugh, I can't believe people still buy into this leftist crap about the working class and the owner class. Like seriously, get a grip. The middle class is where it's at, man. It's all about hard work and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. Yeah, sure, the wealthy have power and all that, but it's not like they're intentionally keeping the rest of us down. They worked hard to get where they are, and if we work hard too, we can be just like them. It's called capitalism, baby! And yeah, there might be some inequality, but that's just how the world works. Stop whining and start hustling if you want to move up in life. Don't blame the rich for your problems. Society isn't reverting back to anything, it's just progressing. So stop with this feudalism comparison, it's just weird and doesn't make any sense.
------
I gotta say, I'm really fed up with all this international politics crap. Iran, North Korea, Palestine, Israel, it's all a big mess. They pretend to make deals and then everything falls apart. It's clear as day that whenever we get involved in these places, they start chanting "death to America" and all that nonsense. But you know what? Trump is actually doing something right for once. He's being realistic and putting America first, which is what we need. And seriously, can we stop with the Russia paranoia already? They're not as big of a threat as people make them out to be. We've seen how weak they are after the whole cold war thing. So let's focus on ourselves and stop wasting energy on these useless countries. End of rant.
------
Wow, Saquon Barkley really went high in the draft! 1.06? That's crazy! I mean, I know he's a talented player and all, but is he really worth that much? Zeke was 1.08 and Fournette was 2.10, and they turned out pretty good too. I don't know much about other sports, but I highly doubt any basketball or baseball rookies were drafted that high. It's just mind-boggling to think that Saquon has the highest ADP of any rookie ever. I'm not trying to hype or de-hype him, I'm just saying it's interesting that he's at the top of the list with all the history we have. Let's see if he lives up to the hype, but damn, that's a lot of pressure on his shoulders.
------
Wow, dude, you seriously need a reality check. I mean, come on, you're actually considering letting your girl's parents dictate your freaking conversations?! Are you for real? If you can't stand up for yourself and set some boundaries, then no wonder they don't see you as "worthy". Grow a pair, man!

And don't even get me started on this whole Indian parents thing. Yeah, sure, not all of them are like that, but let's be honest, a good chunk of them are. They'll go to insane lengths to keep their precious daughters away from guys they don't approve of. So, if you want any chance at all with this girl, you better start respecting the customs and traditions, even if they seem dumb.

Look, if you really care about this girl and want to be with her, then you need to step up your game. Show her and her ultra-controlling parents that you're worth fighting for. Otherwise, just walk away and save yourself the drama. It's as simple as that. Good luck, buddy. You're gonna need it.
------
Uh, seriously? What are you even talking about? First of all, your argument is weak. Just because something isn't explicitly mentioned in the Quran doesn't mean it's automatically false. And why would someone lie about being a prophet? Like, what's the motivation there? Your logic is all messed up. 

And then you bring up this whole thing about him being all humble and stuff. Okay, cool. But does that prove anything? Plenty of people can be humble and still lie through their teeth. Plus, we don't even have solid evidence of how he lived his life. It's all just stories passed down through generations. 

But let's say for a minute that he was telling the truth. Still doesn't prove anything about this whole "one god" thing. People make up religions all the time. It's not like he's the first or the last to do it. And honestly, I don't buy that whole martyr complex. Like, he could have just been stubborn and stuck to his lie because he didn't want to admit he was wrong. People do that too, you know?

So yeah, sorry but your whole argument just doesn't hold up. Try again next time.
------
Wow, OP, you really hit the nail on the head with this one. People are always making excuses for their crappy behavior, thinking it's no big deal. But let me tell you something, these small acts of harm can add up to some serious sh*t.

Take this school cheating situation, for example. Parents pay good money for their kids to get a decent education, and they expect the school to actually do their damn job. But when teachers turn a blind eye to cheating, it undermines the whole system. And guess what? It reflects poorly on the school and future graduates who don't want to be associated with a bunch of cheaters. Society expects better, dammit!

It's the same damn thing with littering. Yeah, that one little bottle might not seem like a big deal, but if everyone starts chucking their trash on the streets, we end up with a goddamn landfill for a city. It's a tragedy of the commons, where people only care about themselves and screw over everyone else.

So, what's the solution? We need to crack down on these rule-breakers and make sure they know there are consequences. OP's post helps show people that we won't tolerate this bullsh*t behavior anymore.
------
Yeah, I totally get what you're saying. Lovecraft is definitely influential and all, but sometimes it feels like George R.R. Martin takes it a bit too far. Like, we get it, Lovecraft has this whole cosmic horror thing going on, but does every freakin' reference in A Song of Ice and Fire have to be some homage to the guy? It's like he's trying too hard to be deep or something.

And don't even get me started on the World of Ice and Fire. I mean, sure, it's cool to have some extra background info, but does anyone really care about some random-ass town that didn't even get a mention in the main series? It just feels like Martin is throwing in all this unnecessary fluff to make the book thicker. I'd rather he focus on finishing the damn series instead of wasting time on pointless side stories.

But hey, that's just my opinion. I know there are die-hard fans out there who eat this stuff up, so to each their own. I'll just stick to enjoying the main books and ignore all the Lovecraftian mumbo jumbo.
------
Damn, this shit is spot on! You're preaching the truth, my dude. And it's not like this is some groundbreaking revelation or anything. There's a shit ton of articles out there that back up this idea. It's all about stress, man. Think about it from an evolutionary perspective.

Kids who go through a fucked up childhood are gonna have a hard time adapting to the world. It's survival instincts, bro. If you grow up in a messed up environment, you're gonna develop some cold and indifferent traits to protect yourself. It's like your brain is constantly on high alert for stress, which can lead to anxiety disorders and feeling helpless.

This PDF I found even straight up says that this kind of messed up upbringing messes with your brain. It screws with your limbic system, which causes anxiety, and damages the cerebellar vermis, which leads to depression. So yeah, these abusive assholes are literally fucking up people's brains.

Alright folks, brace yourselves for a rant. So, I just gotta say, I'm all about that social liberalism and fiscal conservatism, ya know? Like, let's balance those freakin' books already! It's about time America stops drowning in debt. But seriously, can someone please explain to me what the hell those Republicans were thinking when they passed that tax law? It's an absolute disaster. Not only does it explode our deficit, but it also hands over 90% of the benefits to a measly 5% of the population. Talk about screwing over the rest of us hardworking folks!

And don't even get me started on Paul Ryan. Dude promised to balance our budget, but what do we have now? A ginormous frickin' deficit that he forced through the House like it's nobody's business. Seriously, why do we keep voting for these lying, thieving scumbags who only care about lining the pockets of the filthy rich?

Let's wake up, people! It's time to put our money where our mouths are and stop supporting these crooks. America deserves better than this crapshow. Rant over. Peace out.

Yo, check it out. So I just found out this sick fact about these tiger swallowtail caterpillars. They actually lay their eggs on dill plants, you know, the ones they use to make dill pickles. Pretty wild, right? Anyway, I always plant dill in my garden, and almost every damn year, I spot these little green dudes chilling on my plants. They also dig parsley, carrot greens, and queen anne's lace.

But here's the coolest part. When these suckers reach full size, they start wandering around, searching for a sweet-ass high branch to attach to and pupate. And that's when they're super easy to spot. You can even grab them and stick 'em in a butterfly house or terrarium. Feed those little buggers some more dill until they go into their chrysalis. Eventually, they'll emerge as badass butterflies, and you can snap some sick pics before releasing them into the world.

Now, this trick works for most native caterpillars, you feel me? Just figure out what plants they vibe with and grow lots of 'em. Monarchs, for example, love them some milkweed. But the caterpillar in the original post, well, it's into trees and stuff, so not as simple to find. But hey, keep planting and keep discovering, my fellow caterpillar enthusiasts!
------
Alright, listen up folks. I'm not here to sugarcoat anything, so buckle up. Relationships? Yeah, they're hard work, plain and simple. If you think you can coast through one without putting in any effort, then you're in for a rude awakening. And let me tell you, women can be a handful. They're always changing their minds, never satisfied, and it's just the way they are. Trust me, I've had my fair share of experiences.

But here's the thing, ladies and gentlemen. Women nowadays have this messed up idea of equality drilled into their heads. Don't get me wrong, equal rights and all that are important, but it's been taken to the extreme. Men are expected to be the leaders, yet nobody shows us how. We're left in the dark, while these women complain about us not taking charge. It's a damn catch-22.

You know why women want men to make decisions when it comes to dating? It's all about accountability, my friends. They're afraid of it. They don't want to take responsibility for their actions, so
------
Yeah, I totally get where you're coming from. Jon might earn the respect of the North, but obedience? Not a chance. The dude's got way too much Stark in him to just bow down to some Targaryen. And speaking of Targaryens, what's up with burning poor innocent Shireen? Like seriously, does Stannis really think that's gonna stop the damn White Walkers? Personally, I think his whole arc is gonna be done-zo before we even get to the real threat. And if the whole point is to stop the others, why doesn't Stannis just sacrifice himself? I mean, his life has gotta have more magic power than some little girl's. But nah, he's still power-hungry and wants that damn Iron Throne. So yeah, sacrificing himself in a battle for the throne would make way more sense in my book.
------
1) Dude, I never even mentioned the goddamn Quran in my comment. Get it together.

2) And seriously, did you conveniently skip over my point about Christian headcovering? Typical.

3) Look, bro, most religions have their own interpretations and practices that aren't explicitly stated in their holy texts. But that doesn't mean those practices aren't significant. And hey, it also doesn't mean it's the same as parading around with a purely decorative symbol of your religion. 

Let me ask you something, does your church or culture require girls to wear freakin' t-shirts with crosses as a sign of humility? Yeah, didn't think so. So why should a girl who comes from a family that practices Christian headcovering be banned from doing so in class? It's not taking anything away from you, man. It's just making things a little different than what you're used to. Deal with it.
------
Really? Are you seriously going to act like that? The Republican party is a freaking joke. They're all about screwing over the little guy and protecting the interests of the rich. And don't even get me started on Trump. I mean, how can anyone support that orange buffoon? His presidency was a disaster and he's just a complete embarrassment.

And while we're at it, can we talk about climate change? It's real, people! Stop denying the science and start doing something about it. But of course, the Republicans are too busy lining their pockets with money from big oil to actually give a damn about the future of our planet.

I swear, sometimes I can't even handle the stupidity on this subreddit. It's like a breeding ground for ignorant and uninformed opinions. Ugh.
------
Yeah, so like, I totally get where you're coming from. It's messed up that your hubby doesn't realize how crucial body image is for some chicks. Like, seriously dude, sit his dumb ass down and make it clear that your feelings are legit hurt. Don't let him think this is just some small thing to gloss over. He needs to understand the magnitude of how wrecked you are right now. Honestly, it's not just him though, a lot of guys (including myself, gotta admit) suck at empathizing with the opposite gender. It's probably 'cause they're too damn ignorant. We all need to do better and step up our game, ya know? So tell him straight up, and maybe he'll finally get it through his thick skull. Good luck, sis!
------
Wow, it's amazing how little people can appreciate genuine help these days. I mean, seriously? Someone just tells you to contact the airline and suddenly they're hailed as a hero? Do people really need to be spoon-fed such obvious advice? It's insulting to the rest of us who actually put effort into trying to assist.

And don't even get me started on how you completely dismissed my suggestion about the cathay reference. I took the time to offer an alternative solution, but apparently, it went right over your head. But hey, who needs gratitude anyway, right?

You know what, forget about us helpful folks here on this subreddit. If you're so quick to praise the genius of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, then go ahead and rely on them for solving all your future problems. Good luck with that, because I doubt they'll be half as helpful as some of the people here. But hey, what do I know? I'm just another insignificant Redditor trying to lend a hand.
------
Ugh, seriously? Can we just stop with this nonsense already? Like who even cares about these stupid new coins? We already have enough crap cluttering up the crypto space. And what's the point of creating a second set of tokens anyway? It's just gonna make everything more confusing and complicated. Plus, I highly doubt anyone actually wants to deal with this mess. I mean, come on, let's focus on something that actually matters and can make a difference in the real world. This whole idea is just a big waste of time and energy. Can we please move on to something more interesting and useful? Like finding a cure for stupidity. That would be way more productive.
------
Seriously, who comes up with this bullshit? Being poor has nothing to do with intelligence. I mean, have you ever heard of the term "privileged"? Just because someone doesn't have a fat bank account doesn't automatically make them dumb as a rock. There are so many factors that contribute to someone's socioeconomic status, like access to education, opportunities, and systemic disadvantages. So, to all the geniuses out there equating poverty with stupidity, kindly pull your head out of your privileged ass and educate yourselves. Poverty is a complex issue that requires empathy and understanding, not ignorant assumptions.
------
So, here's the thing. I messed up big time. I should have saved up properly like a responsible person, but noooo, I had to go and be an idiot. Now I'm stuck in this crappy situation where I don't have enough money to pay for my stay on this stupid trip I planned. And guess what? I didn't even think about it beforehand! Can you believe that? I just assumed that I would magically have the cash when I needed it.

And you want to know why I'm in this mess? A friggin' concert. Yup, that's right. I blew all my money on a dumb birthday present for someone important to me. But let's be real, was it worth it? Hell no. Now I'm stressing out like crazy, unable to sleep, and realizing just how much of a financial disaster I am. It's all my fault, and I can't believe how dumb I've been.

I need to sort my life out ASAP because clearly, I can't handle money like a grown-up. Ugh, I can't believe I have to wake up in a few hours. FML.
------
lol, I ain't no lawyer or anything, but here's my two cents on this raw fish drama.

So, basically, it seems like you got sick from eating raw fish, right? Well, first things first, I'd say you should stop buying fish from whatever sketchy joint you got it from. Common sense, dude!

Now, as far as the legal stuff goes, it's a damn mess. There are these food safety laws and junk that differ from state to state, so you gotta find out what's the deal in your area. Contact your local health authority or whatever. Or better yet, find yourself a lawyer who knows about this food safety crap.

Now, here's the kicker. Even if the fish was labeled "sushi grade," it doesn't mean squat! There's some fine print that probably covers their sorry butts. But, if the store had a dirty prep area or they were getting complaints left and right about their fish, then you might have a shot at getting some justice.

Look, I'm no expert, but it sounds like a long and messy battle either way. But hey, good luck with all that legal mumbo jumbo, hope you get something out of it!
------
Yeah, I mean, it sucks that healthcare costs keep rising. But let's face it, it's not like we're gonna notice a huge difference in our own wallets if we switch to a single-payer system. Sure, they say it's gonna cost like <cur>32 trillion, but guess what? The US is already projected to spend around <cur>34 trillion on healthcare during that same time period. So basically, it's just a different way of paying for it, right?

Instead of getting screwed over by premiums, copays, coinsurance, and deductibles, we'd be paying through our taxes. But think about it, man. We'd be helping out like 30 million more Americans who don't have access to healthcare right now. Isn't that worth it? Plus, we'd still be spending the same amount of money overall, just in a different way. So why not show some compassion and support a system that benefits everyone?
------
Honestly, I don't get why everyone is making such a big fuss about this Kavanaugh nomination. Yeah, yeah, I know Obama never put forth another nomination after Garland, but come on, that was ages ago. And you think Trump won't do the same if Kavanaugh falls through? Please. 

The leftists are just delusional if they think Mueller's takedown will be thwarted by the Supreme Court. They're too focused on the short game, not realizing that we're playing the long game here. 

And speaking of my state, they tried to pass this dumb bill that would make us worse than freakin' California! Can you believe it? That's why I want the Supreme Court to take these cases when they actually succeed. Screw all this political drama, let's get things done, people!
------
Dude, honestly, you're overthinking this shit. Yeah, the whole banking system is fucked up and all, but who the hell really knows what the top dogs are doing up there? You think they follow some rulebook or something? Nah, man, it's all a bunch of loopholes and shady methods that they use to get away with their bullshit.

And don't even get me started on fighting corruption internationally. Like, sure, the US might be corrupt, but if they decided to crack down on the rich, those billionaires would just hop on their private jets and find some other country to hide in. It's a global problem, my dude.

But you know what really pisses me off? When people bring up rape and child molestation in relation to the rich vs. poor debate. Like, what the fuck does that have to do with anything? Those crimes are fucked up, but they're hard to prove and punish because they're so personal. We could totally go after those sick assholes harder, but then you'd be here complaining about how the legal system screws over the poor too.

Look, man, being rich gives you power and leverage, and that shit can be dangerous. You either gotta be a saint like Bill Gates or accept that you're gonna screw people over with your investments. And all these rich folks, they gotta live behind veils because the average Joe can't handle their wealth. So quit your whining and do something productive, alright?
------
Yo, check out this subreddit I've been lurking on called r/veganfitness. It's actually pretty legit for getting some ideas to mix up your diet and stuff. These vegans are ripped as hell, so clearly they know what they're doing. They've got some bomb-ass recipes too, if you're into that sort of thing.

And here's a little secret for you, my fellow unhealthy bastards. You can totally cheat the system and still get your veggie intake. Just slap some fake meat on your plate next to your real deal meat. Boom! Double the protein, baby! Don't judge me, alright? It works!

But let me just drop a truth bomb on you: seitan is the MVP of vegan gains. That wheat gluten crap is like 70g of protein in every 100g. It's insane, bro! You can use that shit in all sorts of dishes. It's like a freakin' protein gold mine or something.

So yeah, head over to r/veganfitness and thank me later. You might just learn a thing or two while having a laugh at us carnivores trying to get our veggies on the sly. Cheers!

Wow, talk about a total shitshow. It's so damn obvious that Kawhi's uncle is just trying to snake his way into the spotlight and cause drama. And yeah, sure, the Spurs aren't saints either, but let's not pretend like they're the only ones at fault here. Kawhi needs to grow a pair and start taking responsibility for his own decisions. I mean, who the hell chooses their uncle over a legendary team like the Spurs? It's dumb as hell. But whatever, the Spurs will bounce back, they always do. Kawhi, on the other hand, good luck finding a team that'll put up with your diva-ass attitude. You're gonna regret screwing over one of the greatest franchises in NBA history. Enjoy mediocrity, buddy.

Are you serious? Comparing Shinji to Eren is like comparing a crying little baby to a badass titan. Sure, Shinji might have had more combat experience in his EVAs, but that doesn't mean shit when it comes to fighting actual opponents. Eren trained for years and actually knows how to kick some ass. Plus, those angels are nothing compared to titan shifters. They may be clever and creative, but they're still a bunch of wimpy creatures. Eren would tear them apart without breaking a sweat. And let's not forget that Shinji runs away from battles like a scared little bitch. Yeah, he might eventually get his act together and wreck shit, but by then it'll be too late because Eren will be done with him. So, stop making excuses for Shinji and accept the fact that Eren would kick his sorry ass any day.

Hey, OP, thanks for sharing your story! Damn, sounds like you went through some serious shit in that crappy marriage. Can't blame you for opting for an abortion when you weren't ready for the whole single mom drama, especially with that douchebag husband of yours. Good on you for making the choice that was right for you, even though it must have been tough. And now, look at you, with a kickass hubby and two badass pro-choice kids. That's some sweet karma right there.

It's awesome to hear that you support Planned Parenthood and keep those Plan B packs stocked up like a boss. You're doing more than your fair share to help others in need. Keep spreading that love and peace, girl. You rock!

Honestly, this whole Kavanaugh thing is such a freaking circus. Can't believe people are buying into all this crap without any solid evidence. I mean, seriously? We're supposed to assume guilt or innocence based on what? Some vague claims with no real substantiation? Give me a break!

And don't even get me started on the "but high school" defense. Who the hell cares what someone did in high school? We've all done dumb shit back then. It's ridiculous how people are trying to use that as some sort of proof of guilt. It's just a desperate attempt to push their own agenda.

Look, I'm not saying Kavanaugh did it or didn't do it. I'm just saying we don't know! We should let justice do its thing, but in the meantime, stop jumping to conclusions and smearing this dude's name. It's not fair. Can we at least have some freaking common sense here?
------
Yo, can we talk about how Tom Brady straight up walked into the Patriots like he owned the place? I mean, this dude had the audacity to look Robert Kraft, the big boss man, dead in the eye and say, "I'm the best decision this organization has ever made." Like, who does that? And get this, he said it before he even played a single down in the NFL. Talk about confidence!

But let's be real here, this whole thing is just a reflection of the messed up state of journalism nowadays. It's all about getting those sweet clicks and retweets, no matter what you gotta do. So-called journalists these days are all about stirring up controversy and spreading hate, just to get famous. It's pathetic.

Anyway, I can't deny that Brady has some serious skills, but damn, his ego is on another level. But hey, I guess if you're as successful as him, you can afford to be a cocky SOB.
------
Man, I gotta say, this whole o2 and ros stuff is confusing as hell. Like, yeah, having more oxygen in tissues might affect the generation of ros in irradiated tissues, but who knows for sure, right? And don't even get me started on the whole radioresistance in tumors thing. I vaguely remember hearing that oxygenation plays a big role, but like, how exactly? And hey, let's not forget about all those biochemical mechanisms that can neutralize ros. Like, that's a whole other can of worms right there. It's cool that you gave an overview and everything, but honestly, I'm still left wondering which factor is the most important. Oh, and what about the difference between vertebrates and invertebrates? Do they have different typical cell oxygenation or what? Seriously, this whole topic gives me a headache.

Honestly, I don't get why some people on here are so blind to the facts. Sasha and Bayley were hands down the biggest reason NXT was selling out. I mean, come on, ever since they left, the attendance has been tanking. Like, seriously, it's not even up for debate. Takeovers used to sell out like hotcakes when Bayley was there, but now they struggle to even fill half the arena. Look at War Games last year, it was a complete flop compared to Survivor Series the next day.

And don't even get me started on Charlotte. Sure, she headlined HIAC 2016, but that was because of her feud with Sasha, not because she's some big draw. Heels like her aren't meant to be draws, they're there to make the babyfaces look good. It's basic wrestling logic.

But let's bring it back to the present. Is Mickie freaking James a bigger name than Sasha and Bayley? Hell no! These two have been moving merchandise like crazy and have sold out arenas multiple times. And let's not forget about Bayley being the face of NXT when it was at its peak. The Bellas may not be everyone's cup of tea, but they've even made waves in mainstream pop culture. So, sorry Mickie, a one-off reaction at the Royal Rumble doesn't make you a big name. Crowd reactions are just a bunch of noise from a select few.

Man, I gotta say, Henrys ain't too shabby. But let me tell you something, the Winchesters are just plain better. They may be based on old school designs, but that's what gives them that real western vibe, you know? The 1873, 1876, 1892, 1894, and 1895 - those babies are classics.

Now, here's the deal breaker for me: Henrys load through the mag tube, while Winchesters have a legit loading gate. Sure, both have their pros and cons, but I think the majority of folks prefer that Winchester-style gate. It's just more badass, man.

And listen, if you're planning to hunt Wisconsin deer, you better go for a rifle caliber. That means no 1873 or 1892. And let's be real, the 1876 is way too obscure. So that leaves you with the 94 and 95. Both solid choices, dude. But keep in mind, the 95 will cost you a pretty penny. If you're diggin' the 94, you might even find an original one from the 50's for around 4-600 bucks. Not too shabby, huh?

Are you serious? Your arguments are so weak and biased. Just because SG is the only tech path that can defend early zerg all-ins doesn't mean it's the best or most effective option. There are plenty of other strategies that can work just as well, if not better. And your point about harass with oracles being insignificant is just plain wrong. Even if it only kills one drone, that's still a loss for the zerg and a win for the protoss. Plus, the pressure it puts on the zerg to defend against the harassment is valuable in itself. And don't even get me started on your mutalisk argument. Just because Serral had a bad game against Stats doesn't mean mutas are useless against protoss. It all comes down to skill and execution. So stop being so one-sided and open your mind to different strategies and playstyles.

So I've been playing this Blood & Wine DLC for The Witcher 3 and let me tell you, it's freaking awesome! I jumped in at level 34 or maybe 36, just before finishing the main quest because I wanted to get the grandmaster gear and those extra witcher mutations. And guess what? Now I'm level 50 and only halfway through this bad boy! There is just so much sh*t to do in this DLC, it's overwhelming. Seriously, if you're thinking about getting the season pass, just do it. Or better yet, get yourself a game of the year edition with all the extra DLC. Trust me, it's totally worth it. By the way, I've already completed most of the side quests and even kicked some ass in the new qwent games. Man, this DLC has got me hooked!

Wow, talk about making assumptions and generalizations. First of all, just because someone criticizes a country doesn't mean they have a chip on their shoulder. Maybe they're just pointing out flaws or expressing their opinions. And newsflash, every country has its own set of issues and problems, so don't act like your country is perfect.

And seriously, attributing a country's security, peace, and prosperity solely to the US and geography? That's a pretty narrow-minded viewpoint. There are countless other factors that contribute to a nation's well-being, so maybe educate yourself a bit more before making such ignorant claims.

And don't even get me started on trade policies and the current administration. Many of us don't support the government's actions and have been actively speaking up against them. So don't lump everyone together and assume we all share the same beliefs.

Lastly, yes, our health may be intertwined to some extent, but that doesn't give you the right to act superior or hope for our downfall. We're all in this together, so instead of wishing for us to "get our shit together," maybe try fostering a more constructive and collaborative attitude.

Alright, listen up, fellow atheists. I have a bone to pick with this whole god business. So, let's say for a second that there is a god - a sneaky little bugger who's pulling all the strings but trying to hide it. What's the point of that? Are they just trying to mess with our fragile minds? Are they so desperate to fill up hell that they want to trick us into disbelief?

I mean, seriously, if this deity exists and they're going out of their way to make everything seem natural, then they're not just deceitful, they're downright evil. Like, we're talking about a sadistic, twisted mastermind here. And yeah, I'll admit, it's a pretty solid argument for why god might be a complete jerk.

But hold on a second, aren't most Christians and other believers under the impression that their god is all loving and good? Yeah, no thanks. I can't buy into that, even though there are passages in their holy book that suggest the opposite. So, sorry, but I'm gonna have to respectfully disagree with you on this one.

Yo, let's talk about this corporate income tax BS. Honestly, it's just a big fat slap in the face to us regular folks. I mean, who do they think they're fooling? They say they want to stick it to the rich, but guess who ends up taking the hit? Yep, you guessed it, us poor suckers.

Think about it, when the government decides to hit up a big-shot company like Microsoft with an extra million in corporate income tax, what do you think they're gonna do? Raise the prices, baby! And who gets screwed over? Us, the consumers! Like seriously, can't catch a break.

And don't get me started on how this doesn't even give businesses an incentive to not pass on the tax to us. It's like a vicious cycle, man. Every business in the same field has to pay the same tax, so they're all gonna jack up their prices. It's like a domino effect of ripping us off.

So if they really wanna tax the rich, they gotta go straight for their wallets, not mess around with these corporate taxes. 'Cause at the end of the day, it's us regular folks who keep the economy going with our hard-earned cash. Peace out.

Alright, I gotta say this is some messed up sh*t. So you're telling me that your church straight up purged you for expressing your views on church and state? That's next level insanity right there. Like, what the actual f*ck? I mean, I get it, everyone has their own opinions and all, but kicking someone out just because they have a different perspective? That's just plain ridiculous.

I gotta wonder though, what kind of priest would do something like that? I mean, seriously, don't they have more important things to worry about? It's not like you were burning down the damn church or anything. If I were you, I'd go talk to the bishop or something, because it sounds fishy as hell to me. I bet if they kicked out everyone who had a different political view, they'd be left with like five people in the congregation.

But hey, what do I know? Maybe they just really hate it when someone speaks their mind. Screw 'em, man. Find a new church that actually welcomes different opinions instead of acting like a bunch of narrow-minded pricks. Good luck, buddy.

Are you blind or just dumb? I said they don't have highlights, not that they can't go the distance. Learn to read, buddy.

And yeah, on paper they have some talented players, but talent alone doesn't win you games. It's about how they perform on the pitch, and so far they've been flopping left and right. Can't handle the pressure, I guess.

I mean, look at Mbappe. Everyone hyped him up like he's the next big thing, but where was he when it mattered? Nowhere to be found. And Neymar, don't even get me started. Dude is more interested in complaining to the ref than actually playing football.

So yeah, sure, they have the "potential" to go far, but until they prove it on the field, I'm not buying it. They're just a bunch of overhyped prima donnas if you ask me.

Yo, listen up. I gotta say, it ain't as simple as you think when it comes to sentencing disparities. Yeah, I get it, you wanna blame it on the Native people committing more crime. But hold your horses, my friend, it's way more complicated than that. It's about the messed up social connections, the lack of opportunities, and generations stuck in the justice system. It's all about those factors, man, not just being "indigenous." Let's shift the conversation, alright? Let's talk about who these high-risk offenders really are. And guess what? If most of 'em happen to be "indigenous," then maybe we can start digging deeper and understanding why that is. Then, we can actually have a real conversation about how different communities can come together and fix these damn problems. Let's move this discussion forward, people!
